MANUSCRIPTS

THE text of Virgil has been remarkably well pre-
served. In the large number of Virgilian manu-
scripts there are as⁶many as seven that can safely be
assigned to an age as early az the fourth or fifth
century. These are the following, all written in

capital letters, square or rustic :

A. Fragmentum Auguslewn‚ or Schedae lim-olin-
emes, partly in Rome and partly in Berlin;
containing portions of Georg. 1 and 111, with
Aen. ιν, 302-305.

F. Schedae Vallestnae, in Rome ; containing
portions of Georg. 111, iv, and Aen. ι-νιιι, and
preserving some interesting miniatures.

G. Schedae Sarzgallenses‚ at St. Gall, Switzerland.
Eleven leaves of a palimpsest, including
portions of Georg. ιν and Aen. ι, ιιι, lv, w.

M. Codex Medice11s‚ in the Laurentian Library
at Florence. Written before ΑΛ). 494. Con-
tains Ecl. from νι, 48, Georg. and Aen.

P. Codex Palatinus, in the vatican Library,
Rome, but up to 1622 in the palatine Library
at Heidelberg. Out of 280 leaves, 33 here
and there are wanting.
