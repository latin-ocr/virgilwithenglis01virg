AENEID BOOK V

3⁶2 Then,when the races were ended and the gifts
assigned, “ N0w‚” he eries, “whoso hath valour in
his breast and a stout heart, let him come and lift up
his arms with hidebound hands.’' So he speaks, and
sets forth a double prize for the fray3 for the victor,
a steer decked with gold and fillets3 a sword and
noble helmet to console the vanquished. Forthwith,
without pause, Dares shows himself in all his huge
strength, rising amid a mighty murmuring of the
throng—Dares, who alone was wont to face Paris:
’twas he who, by the mound, where great Hector
lies, smote the champion Butes, offspring of Amycus'
Bebrycian race, as he strode forward in his huge
bulk, and stretehed him dying on the yellow sand.
Such was Dares, who at once raises his head high for
the fray, displays his broad shoulders, stretches his
arms, spars right and left, and lashes the air with
blows. For him a match is sought3 but none from
all that throng durst face him or draw the gloves on
to his hands. So, exultant and thinking all resign the
prize, he stood before Aeneas’ feet; then, tarrying
no longer, grasps the bull’s horn in his left hand,
speaking thus : (ἴ Goddess-born, if no man dare trust
himself to the stay, what end shall there be to
my standing? How long is it fitting to keep me
waiting? Bid me lead off thy gift !” Therewith all
the Dardans shouted applause, and bade the promised

pl ize be dulyg criven him.

sat next him on the green couch of grass z “ Entellus,
once bravest of heroes, though in vain, wilt thou so
tamely let gifts so great be carried off without a
struggle Ρ W here now, pray, is that divine teacher,
Ery x, ὃίάΙ)1 famed. Ρ W here thy renown over all Sicily,
