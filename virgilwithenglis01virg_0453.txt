AENEID BOOK IV

with the strength of years, there comes a roar, the
stem quivers and the high leafage thickly strews the
ground, but the oak clings to the crag, and as far as it
lifts its top to the airs of heaven, so far it strikes its
roots down towards hell-—even so with ceaseless ap-
peals, from this side and from that, the herois buffeted,
and in his mighty beart feels the thrill of grief:
steadfast stands his will 3 the tears fall in vain.

‘¹5⁰ Then, indeed, awed by her doom, luckless Dido
prays for death 3 she is wear-xj of gazing on the arch of
heaven. And to make her more surely fulfil her purpose
and leave the light, she saw, as she laid her gifts on
the altars ablaze with incense—·fearful to tell 3-the
holy water darken and the outpoured wine change
into loathsome gore. Of this sight she spoke to
none—no, not to her sister. Moreover, there was in
the palace 3 1113111Ιο chapel to her former lord, which
she cherished in wondrous honour, wreathing it with
snowy fleeces and festal foliage. Thence she heard,
it seemed‚ sounds and speech as of her husband
calling, whenever darkling night held the world;
and alone on the house-tops with ill-boding song the
owl would oft complain, drawing out itsn lingering
notes into a w ail; and 1111011150 many a 531 ing
of the seers of old terrifies her with fearful boding.
In her sleep fierce Aeneas himself hounds 1101· 111 1101·
frenzy3 and ever she seems to be left lonely‚ exer
wending, companionless‚ an endless way, and seeking
her Tyrians in a land forlorn—even as raving Pen-
theus sees the Furies’ band, a double sun and two-
fold Thebes rise to view ; or as when Agamemnon’s
son, Orestes, driven over the stage, flees from his
mother, who is armed with brands and black serpents,
while at the doorway crouch the avenging Fiends.1

Bacchus, and in the Eumenides of Aeschylus the ghost of
Clytaemnestra stirs up the Furies against Orestes, her son.
