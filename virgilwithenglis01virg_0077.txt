ECLOGUE VII

CORYDON

Α Ye mossy springs, and grass soster than sleep, and
¹ the green arbutus that shields you with its scant
Ἴ shade, ward the noontide heat from my flock. Now
ζ comes the summer's parching, now the buds swell on
J the gladsome tendi-il.

THYRSIS

Here we have a hearth and pitchy brands3 here,
¹ a good fire ever blazing and door-posts black with
ἶ never-sailing soot. Here we reck as much of the
ς chill blasts of Boreas as the wolf of the number of
J sheep, or rushing torrents of their banks.

CORYDON

Here stand junipers and shaggy chestnuts; strewn
’ about under the trees lie their own divers fruits 3 now
all nature smiles; but if fair Alexis should quit these
hills you would see the very rivers dry.

THYRSIS

Α The field is parched3 the grass is athirst, dying in
' the tainted aii-3 Bacchus has grudged the hills the
, shade of his vines: but at the coming of my Phyllis
1 all the woodland will be green, and Jupiter, in his
ζ sullness, shall descend in gladsome showers.

CORYDON

The poplar is most dear to Alcides, the vine to
Bacchu2‚1l1e myrtle {o lovely Venus, and his own
laur-el to Phoebus. Phyllis loves hazels, and while
Phyllis loves them, neither the myrtle nor laurel of
Phoebus shall outvie the hazels.
