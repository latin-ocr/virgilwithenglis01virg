GEORGICS BOOK II

22⁶ Now I will tell you how you may distinguish
each. If you shall ask whether a soil be light or closer
than is the wout—for one is friendly to corn, the other
to the vine; the closer to Ceres, all the lightest to
Lyaeus—you must first look out a place and bid a
pit be sunk deep in the solid ground, then put all the
earth back again, and tread the earth level at the top.
If it fall short, this farm-land will be light, and better
suited for the herd and gracious vine3 but if it shows
that it cannot. return to its place, and if there is earth

strong oxen break your ground. As for salty land,
the kind called bitter (unfruitful it is for crops and
mellows not in ploughing3 it preserves not for the
vine its lineage, or for apples their fame), it will
allow this test: pull down from the smoky roof your
close-woven wicker-baskets and wine-strainers: in

f these let that sorry soil, mixed with fresh spring

the osiers3 but the taste will tell its tale full

silently by its own weight; so does a light one. lt
