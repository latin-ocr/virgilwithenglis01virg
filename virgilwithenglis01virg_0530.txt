VIRGIL

sensit et ipse ratem nocturnis rexit in undis,

multa gemens casuque animum concussus amici :

“o nimium caelo et pelago confise serenO, 870
nudus in ignota, Palinure, iacebis harena.''

⁸⁷¹ According] to Servius and Probus, it is due to Varius and
Tucca that the book doses with this verse, Viryil himself having]
added ltere ll. 1 and 2 of Book VI.
