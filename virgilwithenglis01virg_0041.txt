ECLOGUE III

M ENALCAS

Poor sheep, ever luckless flock! While your
master courts Neaera, and fears lest she prefer me
to him, this hireling keeper milks his ewes twice an
hour, and the flock are robbed of strength and the
lambs of milk.

DA MOETAS

Yet have a care to fling these taunts more sparingly
at men. We know who was with you while the goats
looked askance‚ and in what chapel—but the easy
Nymphs laughed.

MENALCAS

The day, οἳ course, when they saw me hackiug
Micon’s plantation and his young vines with malicious

knife.

DA MOETAS

Or it was here, by the old beeches, when you
broke Daphnis' bow and arrows3 for you were sore,
1 you spiteful Menalcas, when you saw them given to
the boy, and could you not have harmed him in some
way, you would have died.

M ENA LCAS

What are masters like to do, if their knaves ¹ are
so bold? Did I not see you, rascal, snaring Damou’s
goat, while his mongrel barked madly? And when
I cried: “ Where is yon sellow running? Tityrus,
round up the flock ἔ ” you were skulking beyond the
sedge.

² Servius says: “pro servo furem posuitl‘ Au alternative
rendering is: “ What can owners do when thieves are ει)
ἀαι·ἰῑ]ἕῖ” So Page and Waltz.
