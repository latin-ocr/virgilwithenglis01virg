corn in lands whence you have first carried off the
pulse that rejoices in its quivering pods,'or the fruits
of the slender vetch, or the brittle stallis and rattling
tang-le of the bitter lupine. For 3 crop of flax
parches the ground ; oats parch it, and poppies‚
steeped in Lethe's slumber. Yet by changing crops
the toil is light: only be not asharned to feed fat the
dried-out soil with rich dung, and to scatter grimy
ashes over the exhausted fields. Thus also, with
change of crop, the land finds rest, and meanwhile
not thankless is the unploughed earth. Often, too,
it has been useful to fire barren fields, and burn the
light stubble in crackling flaines; whether it be that
the earth derives thence hidden strength and rich
nutriment‚ or that in the flame every taint is haked
out and the useless molsture sweats from it, or that
that heat opens fresh paths and loosens hidden
pores, by which the sap may reach the tender
mades, or that it rather hai-dens the soil and narrows
the gaping veins, that so the searching showers may
not barm, or the blazing sun's fierce tyranny wither

it, or the North-wind’s piercing cold.

with the mattock breaks up the sluggish clods, and
drags over it wicker hurdles3 nor is it for naught

' that golden Ceres views him from high Olympus.1

Much service, too, does he who turns his plough and

Ξ again breaks crosswise through the ridges which he
¹. raised when first he cut the plain, ever at his post to
ἶ discipline the ground, and give his orders to the fields.

1⁰⁰ For moist summers and sunny winters‚ pray,

Ξ ye farmers! With winter’s dust most gladsome is
’ the corn, gladsome is the field : under no tillage does

Mysia so glory, and then even Gargar-us marvels
² zze. she rewards him richly.
