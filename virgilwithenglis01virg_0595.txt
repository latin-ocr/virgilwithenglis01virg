8⁶⁷ Then father Anchises with upwelling tcars
began t “ O my son, ask not of the vast sorrow of thy
people. Him the fates shall but show to earth, nor
longer suffer him to stay. Too mighty, O gods, ye
deemed the Roman stock would be, were these gifts
lasting. What wailing of men shall that famous Field 1
waft to Mavors' mighty city! What funeral—state, O
Tiber, shalt thou see, as thou glidest past the new-
built tomb! No youth of llian stock shall exalt so

promise of what he is likely to become. Some render, “shall
unse so high in hope.''

³ To “ burst the harsh bonds of fate '³ means to escape the
early death to which he is doomed. The conditional sentence
is mixed in form, because Anchises expresses a wish as well as
a condition, for even as he utters the thought he realizes its
hopelessness. Page (after lVagner) treats si qua fata aspera
'rumpas as an exclamation. and makes lu Marcellus eris an
independent sentence. While there is much to be said for
this view, I cannot accept it.
