AENEID BOOK III

³²¹ “ ‘O happy beyond all others, maiden daughter
of Priam, bidden to die at a foeman’s tomb, beneath
Troy’s lofty walls, who never bore the lot's award‚

Chaonian and the whole land Chaonia from Chaon of
Troy, and placed on the heights a Pergamus, this

Lives he yet and feeds he 011 the air of heaven?

ζ a great company. He knows us for his kin, joy-
ἰ fully leads us to the gates, and freely pours forth

Γ tears at every word. I advance, and recognize a

ἶ little Troy, with a copy of great Pergamus, and a
¹* dry brook that takes its name from Xanthus, and
