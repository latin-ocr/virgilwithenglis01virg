AENEID BOOK ΙΙ

And with no doubtful portents did Tritonia give
signs thereos. Scarcely was the image placed within
the camp, when from the upraised eyes there
blazed forth flickering flames, salt sweat coursed
over the limbs, and thrice, wonderful to relate, the
goddess herself flashed forth ² from the ground with
shield and quivering spear. Straightway Calchas
prophesies that the seas must be essayed in ssight, and

¹ that Pergamus cannot be uptorn by Argive weapons,

unless they seek new omens at Argos, and escort

ζ back the deity, whom they have taken away over-
? seas in their curved ships. And now that before
ἶ the wind they are bound for their native Mycenae,
f it is but to get them forces and attendant gods;
³ then, recrossing the sea, they will be here unlooked

for. So Calchas interprets the omens. This image,

, at his warning, they have set up in atonement for
³ the Palladium, for the insulted deity, and to expiate
1: the woeful sacrilege. Yet Calchas bade them raise
ἰ this mass of interlaced timbers so huge, and so to
' build it up to heaven, that it might find uo entrance
at the gateS, be drawn within the walls, or guard thc
¹ people under shelter of their ancient saith. For if

hand of yours should wrong Minerva's offering, then
utter destruction—may the gods turn rather on him-

¹ self that augu1·y!-would fall on Priam‘s empire and
’ the Phrygians; but if by your hands it climbed into
Ξ your city, Asia would even advance in mighty war
3 to the walls of PelopS,2 and such would be the doom
ἱ awaiting our offspring !'
