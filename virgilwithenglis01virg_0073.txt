MELIBOEUS

DAPHNJS, 11 0113110οἆ, had made his seat beneath a
whispering ilex, while Corydon and Thyrsis had
driven their flocks together—Thyrsis his sheep,
Corydon his goats swollen with milk—-both in the
bloom of life, Arcadians both, ready in a match to
sing, as well as to make reply. To this place, while I
sheltered my 'cender myrtles from 1110 cold, my he-
goat, the lord of the flock himself, had strayed; and
lo! I catch sight of Daphnis. As he in 111111 saw me,
“Quick,'' he eries, “come hither, M‹·liboeus; your
goat and kids are safe‚ and ifyou 0311 idle awhile, pray
rest beneath the shade. Hither your steers will of
themselves come over the meadows 10 drink3 here
Mincius fringes his green banks with waving reeds,
and from the hallowed oak swarm humming bees. ”
14 W 1131 could I do? I had no Alcippe or Phyllis
10 pen my new· -weaned lambs 31 1101110; and the
match—Cory don against Thyrsis—w as a mighty one.
Still, Ι 0011111οᾶ 111011 sport abov·e my 11 oxk. So 111
alter nate verses the pair began to compete· , alternate
verses the Muses were fain to 100311.2 These Corydon,

those Thyrsis repeated in turn.

CORYDoN

Ye Nymphs of Libethra, my deligh'c, either grant
me such 3 sti-ain as ye gave my Codrus—the lays he
makes come nearest 10 Αρο11οἐ-01, if such power is
not for us all, here on 1110 hallowed pine shall hang
my tuneful pipe.
