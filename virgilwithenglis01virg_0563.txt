death.¹ N ear them were those on false charge con-
demned to die. Yet not without lot, not without
a judge, are these places given: Minos, presidfflg,
shakes the urn 3 ’tis he calls a court of the silent, and
learns lnen's lives and misdeeds. The region there-
after is held by those sad souls who in innocence
wrought their own death and, loathing the light, flung
away their lives. How gladly now, in the air above,
would they bear both want and harsh distress! Fate
withstand83 the unlovely mere with its dreary water
enchains them and Styx impl-isons with his ninesold
circles.

440 Not far from here, outspread on every side, are
shown the Mourning Fields; such is the name they
bear. Here those whoin stern Love has consumed
with cruel wasting are hidden in walks withdrawn,
embowered in a myrtle grove3 even in death the
pangs leave them not. In this region he sees
Phaedra and Procris, and sad Eriphyle, pointing to
the wounds her cruel son had dealt, and Evadne and
Pasiphae. With them goes Laodamia, and Caeneus,
once a youth, now a woman, and again turned back
by Fate into her form of old. Among them, with
wound still fresh, l'hoenician Dido was wandering in
the great forest, and soon as the Trojan hero stood
nigh and knew her, a dim form aluid the shadows
——even as, in the early mouth, one sees or fancies he
has seen the moon rise amid the clouds—he shed
tears, and spoke to her in tendet love: “ Unhappy
Dido! then was the tale brought me true, that thou
wert no more, and hadst sought thy doom with the
sword? &Vas Ι, alas! the cause of death to thee?

² As Henry says, infants are placed in the very entrance ot
Hades, because they had died at the entrance of life. Their
place is one neither of punishment nor of joy.
