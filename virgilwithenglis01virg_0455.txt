AENEID BOOK IV

⁴¹7⁴ So when, outworn with anguish, she caught
the madness and resolved to die, in her own beart
she determines the time and manner, and accosts
her sorrowsul sister, with mien that veils her plan and
on her brow the calm of hope.

47⁸ “Sister mine, I have found a way—wish thy
sisterjoy—to return him to me or release me from my
love for him. Near Ocean's bound and the setting
sun lies Aethiopia, farthest of lands, where mightiest
Atlas on his shoulders turns the sphere, inset with
gleaming stars. Thence a priestess of Massylian
race has been shown me, warden of the sane of the
Hesperides, who gave (lainties to the dragon and
guarded the sacred boughs on the tree. sprinkling
dewy hohey and slumberous poppieS. With her spells
she professes to set free the hearts of whom she wills,
but on others to bring cruel love-pains; to stay the
flow of rivers and turn back the stars3 she awakes
the ghosts of nigl1t; and thou shalt mark earth
rumbling under thy feet and ash-trees coming down
from mountains. Ι call heaven to witness and thee,
dear sister mine, and thy dear life, that against my
will Ι arm myself with magio arts ! Do thou seeretly
raise up a pyre in the inner court under the sky,
and heap up thereon the arms that heartless one
left hanging in my bower, and all his affitire and
the bridal bed that was my undoing. Ι would
fain destroy all memorials of the abhorred wretch,
and the priestess so directs.'' Thus she speaks
and is silent; pallor the while overspreads her
face. Yet Anna thinks not that her sister veils
her death under these strange rites; her mind
dreams not of such frenzy nor fears she aught worse
than when Sychaeus died. So she makes ready as
bidden.
