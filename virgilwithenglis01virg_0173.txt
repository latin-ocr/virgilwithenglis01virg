GEORGICS BOOK II

⁴¹²⁶ Fruit—trees, too, so soon as they feel their stems
firm, and come to their strength, swiftly push forth
Skyward with inborn force, needing no help from us.
No less, meanwhile, does every wood grow heavy
with fruit, and the birds’ wild haunts blush with
crimson berries. Cattle browse on the cytisus,the high
wood yields pine-brands‚ the fires of night are fed
and pour forth light. And can men be slow to plant
and bestow care ? Why need I pursue greater
themes ἓ 1 The willows and lowly broom—they either
yield leafage for the sheep or shade for the shepherd,
a fence for the crops and food for honey. And what
joy it is to gaze on Cytorus waving with boxwood,
and on groves of Narycian pitch ! What joy to view
fields 'chat owe no debt to the harrow, none to the
care of man! Even the barren woods 011 Caucasian
peaks, which angi-y eastern gales ever toss and tear,
yield products, each after its kind, yield useful
timber, pines for ships, cedars and cypresses for
houses. From these the fai-mers turn spokcs for
wheels, or drums 2 for their wains3 from these they
lay broad keels for boats. 'she willow's wealth is 111
its osiers, the elm’s in its leaves, but the myrtle and
the cornel, that weapon of war, abeund 111 stout spem·-
shafts3 yews are bent 11110 ltin-aean bows. So, too,
smooth lindens and the box, polished by the lathe, take
shape and are hollowed by the sharp stcel. So, too,
the light alder, sent down 1116 Po, swims the raging
wave; 80, too, the bees hive 111611· swarms 111 1116 1101101ν
mik-trees, and 111 the heart of a rotting ilex. What
