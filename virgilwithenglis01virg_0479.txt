AENEID BOOK V

sold seven times, peacesully circling the mound and
gliding among the altars ; his back chequered with
blue spots, and his scales ablaze with the sheen of
dappled gold, even as in the clouds the rainbow
darts a thousand shifting tints athwart the sun.
Aeneas was awestruck at the sight. At last, crawl-
ing with long train amid the bowls and polished
cups, the serpent tasted the viands, and again, all
hai-inless, crept beneath the tomb, leaving the altars
where he fed. More eagerly, therefore, does he
renew his father's interrupted rites, knowing not
whether to deem it the genius of the place οι· the
attendant spirit of his sire. Two sheep he slays,
as is meet, two swine, and as many dark-backed
heifers, while he poured wine from howls and called
great Anchises' shade and the ghost released from
Acheron. Moreoverq his comrades, as each has store,
gladly bring gifis, heap the altars and slay the
steers ; others in turn set the cauldrons and, stretched
along the grass, put live coals under the spits and
roast the flesh.

1⁰4 The looked-for day had come, and now the
steeds of Phaethon ushered in the ninth Dawn with
cloudless light. The name and fame of noble
Acestes had stirred the countryside; in mci-ry
groups the people tbi-onged the shore, some to
see the sons of Aeneas, and some ready to contend.
First of all the prizes are laid out to view in the
midst of the course—sacred tripods, green gar-
lands and palms, the victors' prize3 armour and
purple-dyed garnients, with talents of silver and
gold. Then from a central mound the truinpet
proclaims the opening of the games.

1¹4 For the first contest enter four well-matched
ships of heavy oars, picked from all the fleet.
