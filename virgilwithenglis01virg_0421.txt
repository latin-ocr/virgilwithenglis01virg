AENEID BOOK ΙΙΙ

when, lo! from the narrow fastness of Pe1orus the
north wind reaches us. Past the mouth of the Pan-
tagias with its living rock I voyage—pasb the Me-
garian bay and low-lying Thapsus. Such were the
coasts Achaemenides, comrade ofthe luckless Ulysses,
pointed out, as he retraced his former wanderings.

⁶92 “ Stretched in front of a Sicanian hay lies an
island, over against wave-beaten Plemyrimn; men
of old called it Ortygia. Hither, so runs the tale,
Alpheus, river of Elis, forced a secret course beneath
the sea, and now at thy fountain, Arethusa, mingles
with the Sicilian waves. As bidden, we worship the
great gods of the land, and thence Ι passed the won-
drous rich soil of marssly Helorus. Next we skirt the
high reefs andjutting rocks of Pachynus ; and afar off
Camerina—Fate forbade that she ever be disturbed
—is seen with the Geloan plains, and Gela, named
after its impetuous river. Then steep Acragas, once
the breeder of noble steeds, shows in the distance
her mighty walls3 and, with the winds vouchsafed, I
leave thee behind, palm-girh Selinus, and skir'c ’the
shoals of Lilybaeum, perilous with blind rocks. Next
the har-bour of Drepanum and its joy1ess shore
receive me. Here I, who have been driven by so
many ocean—storms, lose, alas! my father Anchises,
solace of every care and chance ; here, best of fathers,
thou leavest me in my wear-iness, snatched, alas ! from
such mighty perils all for naught. Nor ‹lid the seer
Helenus, though he warned me of many horrors, nor
grim Celaeno foretell me this grief. This was⁴my last
trial, this the goal of my long voyaging3 departing
thence, the god drove me to your shores.'’

71⁶ Thus father Aeneas, before an eager throng,
alone recounted the dooms ordained of heaven, and
taught the story of his wanderings. At last he ceased,
and here, making an end, was still.
