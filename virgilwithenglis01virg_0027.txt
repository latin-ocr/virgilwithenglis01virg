M ELIBOEUS

Yon, Tityrus, lie under your spreading beech’s
covert, wooing the woodland Muse on slender reed,
but we are leaving our country's bounds and sweet
fields. We are outcasts from our country3 you,
'l'ity1-uS, at ease beneath the shade, teach the woods
to re—echo “ fair Amaryllis.'’

TITYRUS

O Meliboeus, it is a god who wrought for us this
peace—for a god he shall ever be to nie-3 often shall
a tender lamb from our folds stain hi< altar. Of his
grace my kine roam, as you see, and Ι, their master,
play what I will on my rustic pipe.l

MELIBOEUS

well, Ι grudge you not—rather I marve13 such
unrest is there on all sides in the land. See, heart-
sick, I myself am driving my goats along, and here,
Tityrus, is one I scarce can lead. For here just now
amid the thick hazels, after hard travail, she dropped
twins, the hope of the flock, alas! on the naked flint.

¹ In this pastoral allegory Tityrus represents Vix-gil, who
went to Rome and appealed successfully to Octavian (after-
wards Augustus) against the confiscation of his farm.
