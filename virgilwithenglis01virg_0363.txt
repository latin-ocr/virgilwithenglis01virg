AENEID BOOK II

⁶²⁴ “ Then, indeed, methought all Ilium sank in
flames and Nep'tune's Troy was upturned from her
base—even as when on mountain-tops woodmen
emulously strain to overturn 311 ancient ash-tree‚
which has been hacked with many a blow of axe
and iron; it ever threatens to fall, and nods with
trembling leafage and rocking erest, till, little by
little, overcome with wounds, it gives one loud last
groan and, uptorn from the ridges, comes crashing
down. I descend and, guided by 3 god, make my
way amid fire and foes. Weapons give place and the
flames retire.

⁶³⁴¹ “And now, when Ι had reached the door of
my father’s house and the dear old home, my sire,
whom it was my first longing to beai· high into the
hills, and whom first I sought, refused, since Troy
was laid low, to prolong his days or suffer exile.
‘Ye,’ he eried, ‘whose blood has the freshness of
youth and whose strength stands sound in native
vigour, do ye turn to flight. For me, had the
lords of heaven willed that Ι should lengthen lise's
thread, they would have spared this my home.
Enough and more is it that I have seen one destruc-
tion, and have survived one capture of the city.¹ To
my body thus lying, yea thus, bid farewell and
depart! 2 With my own hand I shall find death ; the
foe will take pity and seek my spoils3 light is the
loss of burial. Hated of heaven and useless, I have
long stayed the years, ever since the Father of gods·
and king of men breathed upon me with the winds
of his bolt and touched me with his fi1·e.’ ³

¹ Troy was once destroyed by Hercules, after Laomedon
deceived him.

² i.e. treat me as a corpse laid out for burial.

³ Anchises, it is said, was blasted by a lightning-holt for

f! boasting of the love of Venus.
