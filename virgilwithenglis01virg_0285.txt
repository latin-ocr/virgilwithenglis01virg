AENEID BOOK 1

great king, dost thou grant? Antenor could escape
the Achaean host, thread safely the Illyrian gulfs and
inmost realms of the Liburnians, and pass the springs
of Timavus, whence through nine mouths, with a
mountain’s mighty roar, it comes a bursting ssood and
buries the fields under its sounding sea.1 Yet here he
set Padua's town, a home for his Teucriam, gave 3
name to the race, and hung up the arms of Troy3
now, settled in tranquil peace, he is at rest. But
we, thy offspring, to whom thou dost grant the
heights of heaven, have lost our ships—O shame
unutterable!-a11d, to appease one angry foe, are
betrayed and kept far from Italian shores. Is this
virtue’s guerdon? Is it thus thou restorest us to
empire?¹'

²54 On her smiling, with that look wherewith he
clears sky and storms, the Father of men and gods
gently kissed his daughter's lips, and then spake
thus :

²5⁷ “Spare thy fear, Lady of Cythera; thy children's
sates abide unmoved. Thou shalt see Lavinium’s city
and its promised walls 3 and thou shalt raise on high
to the starry heaven great-souled Aeneas. No thought
has turned me. This thy son—sor, since this care
gnaws at thy heart, I will speak and, further unroll-
ing the scroll of fate, will disclose its secrets—shall
wage a great war in Italy? shall crush proud nations,
and sor his people shall set up laws and city walls;
till the third summer has seen him reigning in Latium
and three winters have passed 111 camp since the
Rutulians were laid low.³ But the lad Ascanius,
now sun-named Iulus—Ilus he waS, while the Ilian
state stood firm in sovereiguty-—shall fulfil in empire

³ i.e. after conquering the Rutulians Aeneas will spend
three winters in camp before founding Lavinium.
