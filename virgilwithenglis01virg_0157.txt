GEORGICS BOOK II

1⁹⁵ But if you are more fain 1ο keep hen-ds and
calx-es, 01· to breed sheep, 01 goats that blight the
plants, 111011 haste to the glades and distant meads of
rich Tarentum, or to such a plain 35 hapless Mantua
lost, giving food to snowy swans with its grassy
stream. There the flocks will lack nor limpid
springs nor herbage, and 311 that the herds will
crop in the long days the chilly dew will restore
in 0110 short night.
2⁰³ Land that is black‚ and rich beneath the share's
pressure and with a crumbly soil—for such a soil we
try to rival with our ploughing—is, in the main, best
for 00111 ; from no other land will you see more wagons
wending homeward behind slow bullocks; or land
from which the angry ploughman has carried off the
timber, levelling groves that have idled many 3 year,
and up-tearing by their 110ορ051 10015 1110 0111011
11011105 of the birds—these, lo! leave their 110515 and
seek the sky, but forthwith the untried plain ι31151035
g under 1110 driven ploughshare. For as to the hungry
¹ grave] of a hilly country, it 503100 serves the bees
; with lowly spurge and rosemary3 and the rough tufa
: and the chalk that black water-snakes have eaten
, out betoken that 110 011101 1311115 give serpents food
5051νο01, or furnish such winding 00110115. But if a
5011 exhales thin mists and eur-ling vaponrs, if it
drinks in 111οῗ511110 and throws 11 off again at will, if
3 it always clothes itseif in the verdure of its own grass,
ε and 11311115 1101 1110 51001 with scnrf and salt 11151, 11131
ξ is the one to 1111031110 your 011115 111 joyous vines, the
ς 0110 to be rich in 011 of olive, the 0110 you will find,
3 35 you till, 10 be indulgent to cattle and submissim
ἓ 10 1110 crooked share. Such 15 1110 soil rich Capua
ἶ ploughs, and the coast near the Vesuvian ridge, and
¹ Clanius, unkindly to fol-lom Acerrae.
