AENEID BOOK I

‘²⁹⁷ So speaking, he sends the son of Maia down from
heaven,that the land and towers of new-builtCarthage
may open to greet the Teucrians, and Dido, ignorant
of fate, might not bar them from her lands. Through
the wide air he flies on the oarage of wings, and
speedily alights on the Libyan coasts. At once he
does his bidding, and, God willing it, the Phoenicians
lay aside their savage thoughts 3 above all, the queen
receives a gentle mind and gracfous purpose towards
the Teucrians.

shoulders 111 11111111833 fashion she had slung the ready
bow and had given her hair to the winds to scatter3
her knee bare, and her flowing robes gathered in a
knot. Before 118 speaks, “ Ho! ’² she eries, “ tell me,
youthS, if haply ye have seen a sister of mine here
straying, girt with (11111181- and a dapplcd lynx's hide,
or pressing with shouts on the track of a foaming
