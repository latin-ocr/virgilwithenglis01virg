Tuus far the tillage of the fields and the star-s of
heaven: now thee, Bacchus, will I sing, and with
thee the forest saplings, and the offspring of the
slow-growing olive. Hither, Ο 1161136311 sire ! Here

field teeming with the harvest of the vine, and the
vintage foams in the brimming vats. Come hither,
O Lenaean sire, strip off thy buskins and with me
plunge thy naked legs 111 'che new must.

trees. For some, under no man's constraint, spring
up os their own free will, and far and wide claim the
plains and winding rivers3 such as 'che limber osier and

1 shade. These are the modes Nature first ordained;
1 these give verdure to every kind of forest-trees and
ἶ shrubs and sacred graves.

’ρ course discovered for herself. One man tears away
