v and fierce beasts sport in measured time, then stifl
'. oaks nod their top& No such joy has the rock of
³ Parnassus in Phoebus ; no such a marvel to Rhodope
² and Ismarus is Orpheus.

ὲ ³1 For he sang how, through the great void, were
brought together the seeds of eartli,and air, and sea,
⁵ and streaming fire with-al ; how from these elements
j came all beginnings and even the young globe of the
¹ world grew into a mass 3 how then it began to harden
[- the ground, to shut Nereus apart in the deep, and,
ῗ little by little, to assume the forms of things3 how
ἔ next the earth is awed at the new sun shining and
ζ from the uplifted clouds fall showers; when first

there over mountains that know them not.

41 Then he tells of the stones that Pyrrha threW,
⁴ of Saturn’s reign, of the birds of Caucasus, and the
,Ι theft of Prometheus. To these he adds the tale of the
ὲ spring where Hylas was left, and how the seamen
’ called on him, till all the shore rang “Hylas! Hylas!¹'
Now he solaces Pasiphae—happy one, if herds had
¹ never been !—with her passion for the snowy bull.
³ Ah, unhappy girl, what madness seized thee? ‘she
daughters of Proetus filled the fields with unreal
Ρ lowings, yet not one was led by so foul a love for
, beasts, albeit each had feared the yoke for her neck,
ι’ and often looked for horns on her smooth brow. Ah !
¹ unhappy girl,thou art now roaming on the hills: he,
pillowing his snowy side on soft hyacinths, under a
dark ilex chews the pale grass, or courts some
heifer in the great herd. “ Close, Nymphs, Nymphs
of Dicte, close ye now the forest glades, if so, per-
chance, the bull's truant footsteps may meet my
eyes3 it may be that, tempted by a green meadow
