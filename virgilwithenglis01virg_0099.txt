ECLOGUE X

my side among the willows‚under 'the creeping vine—
Phyllis culling me garlands, Amyntas singing songS.
Here are cold springs, Lycoris, here soft meadows‚
here woodland3 here, with thee, time alone would
wear me away. But now amad passion for the stem
god of 11’·ε11 keeps me in ai ms in the midstof w( ·1pon s
and oppos} ng foes; while thou, far from thy 1131116 so} ·l
——O that it w 616 not for me to believe such a tale! —
art gazing, ah, heartless one! on Alpi ne 5110113 and
the frost-bound Rhine, apart from me, all alone. Ah,
may the frosts not harm thee! Ah, may not the
jagged ice cut thy temler feet l

⁵⁰ “I will be gone, and ’1116 strains I composed in
Chalcidian verse 1 Ι will play on a Sicilian shepherd's
pipe. Well I know thatin the woods, amid wild beasts'
dens, itis better to suffer and carve my love on the
> young trees. They will grou-'3 thou, too, my love,
wilt grow. Meanwhile, with the Nymphs I will roam
o'er Maenalus, or hunt fierce boars. No frosts will
stay me from girdling with my honnds the glades of
Parthenius. Even noxv, methinks, Ι pass over rocks
and echoing groves3 'tis a joy to wing Cydonian
shasts from my Parthian bow l As if this could hezil
my srenzy, or as if that god could learn pity for
human sori-ows! Now once more, nor Hal‘nadryads
nor even songs have charnis for me3 once more
adieu, even ye woods ἔ No toils of ours can change
that god, not though in the heari: of winter we
drink the Hebrus and brave the Thracian snows and
their wintry sleet, not though, when the bark dit-s
and withers on the lofty 61111, we drive to and fro
the Aethiopians' sheep beneath the star of Cancer!
Love conquers all; let us, too, yield to Love ¹''
