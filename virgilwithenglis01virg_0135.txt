GEORGICS BOOK Ι

3⁹3 Nor less after rain may you foresee bright
2¹. suns and cloudless skies, and know them by sure signs.
'For then the stars' bright edge is seen undimmed,
ιζ and the moon rises under no debt to her brother’s
ῃ rays,1 and no thin fleecy clouds pass over the sky.
., Not now do the halcyons, the pride of Thetis, spread
ξ their wings on the shore to catch the Warm sun, nor
«lv do the uncleanly swine think of tossing straw bundles
{1 to pieces with their snouts. But the mists are
ἰ prone to seek the valleys‚ and rest on the plain, and
ἶ the owl, as she watehes the sunset from some high
ξ] peak, vainly plies her evening song. Nisus is seen
fliz aloft in the clear sky, and Scylla suffers for the
ιιι crimson look. Wherever she flees, cleaving the light
ις air with her wings, lo! savage and ruthless, with
ι loud whirr Nisus follows through the sky3 where
³ Nisus mounts skyward, she flees in haste, cleaving
l* the light air with her wings. Then the rooks, with
l* narrowed throat‚ thrice or four times repeat their
ι’ sost eries, and oft in their high nests, joyous with some
ἱ strange, unwonted delight, chatter to each other
{¹ amid the leaves. Glad are they, the rains over, to
t see once more their little brood and their sweet nests.
,ᾖ Not, methinks‚ that they have wisdom from on high,
f* or from Fate a larger foreknowledge of things to be;
fl but thatwhen the weather and fitful vapours of the sky
Η have turned their course, and Jove, wet with the south
ι winds, thickens what just now was rare, and makes
Ι rare what now was thick, the phases of their minds
ll change, and their breasts now conceive impulses, other
ἑξ than they felt, when the wind was chasing the clouds.
ἑξ Hence that chorus of the birds in the fields, the glad-
PE ness of the cattle, and the exulting eries of the rooks.

Ι 3 ¹ “Apparently this means that the moon is very brilliant,
, as though shining with her own and not with a borrowed
[ζ 1ight.” (Pago).
