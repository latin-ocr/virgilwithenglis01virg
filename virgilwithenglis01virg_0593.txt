AENEID BOOK VI

Fabricius, poor, yet a prince? or thee, Serranus,
sowing the seed in thy furrow? Whither do ye
hurry my weary steps, O Fabii? Thou art he, the
mightiest, who singly, by delaying, restorest our
state.1 Others, 1 doubt not, shall beat out the
breathing bronze with softer lines 3 shall from marble
draw forth the features of life; shall plead their causes
better, with the rod shall trace the paths of heaven
and tell the rising of the stars: remember thou, O
Roman, to rule the nations with thy sway—these
shall be thine arts -to crown Peace with Law,2t0 spare
the humbled, and to tame in war the proud !’'

⁸⁵4 Thus father Anchises, and, as they marvel,
pursues: “ Lo! how Marcellus advances, glorious in
his splendid spoils? and towers triumphant over all 1
Τ116 Roman realm, when upheaved in utter confusion,
he, a knight,4 shall support; he shall strike down
Carthaginian and insurgent Gaul, and a third time
hans· up the captured arms to father Quirinus! ’²

3⁶⁰ And hereon Aeneas, for he saw coming with
him a youth⁵ of wondrous beauty and brilliant in his
arms—but his face was sad and his eyes downcast:
“Who, father, is he who thus attends him on his

reading pacis (for which there is slight authority) the meaning
is “to impose (on the conquered) the law of peace.''

³ The spolia opima were the spoils taken “when the general
slew the general of the enemy.'' M. Claudius Marcellus won
them at Clastidium in 222 B.c.‚ when he slew the chief of
the Insubrian Gauls. His only predecessors in this seat were
Romulus and Cossus (841).

‘² The battle of Clastidium was mainlya cavalry engagement.
It was also under Mer-cellusthat the Romans won their first)
, victory over Hannibal at Nola.

⁵ This is the young Marcellus, son of the Emperor-'s sister
Octavia. He was adopted by Augustus and chosen as his
successor, but died in 23 B.O.‚ in his twentieth year, universally
lainented.
