AENEID BOOK I

¹² There was an ancient city, the home of Tyrian
settlers, Carthage, over against Italy and the Tiber's
mouths afar, rich in wealth and stern in war’s pur-
suits. This, 'tis said, Juno loved above all other lands,
holding Samos itselfless dear. Here was her armour,
here her chariot3 that here should be the capital
of the nations, should the fates perchance allow it,
was even then the goddess’ aim and cherished
hope. Yet in truth she had heard that a race was
springing from Trojan blood, to overthrow some day
the Tyrian towers; that from it a people, kings of
broad realms and proud in war, should come forth
for Libya's downfall ε such was the course ordained of
fate. The daughter of Saturn, fearful of this aud
mindful of the old war which erstwhile she had
fought at Troy sor her beloved Argos-not yet, too,
had the cause of her wrath and her bitter sorrows
faded from her mind: deep in her heart lie stored
the judginent of Paris and her slighted beauty's
wrong, her hatred of the race ¹ and the honours paid
to ravished Ganymede—inflamed herehy yet inore,
she tossed on the wide main the Trojan remnant, left
by the Greeks and pitiless Achilles, and kept them
far from Latiun13 and many a year they wandered‚
driven by the fates o‘er all the seas. So vast was
the effort to found the race os Rome.

34 Hardly out of sight of Siciliam land were they
spreading their sails seaward, and merrily ploughing
the foaming brine with brazen prow, when Juno,
nursing an undying wouud deep in her heart, thus to
herself spake :

3⁷ “ What Σ Ι resign my purpose, baffled, and fail to
turn from Italy the Teucrian king l The fates, doubt-

¹ Hated, because sprung from Dardanus, son of Jupiter and
Electra, Juno's rival.
