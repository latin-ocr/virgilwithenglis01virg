AENEID BOOK VI

⁷⁷ But the prophetess, not yet brooking the sway
of Phoebus, storms wildly in the cavern‚ if so she may
shake the mighty god from off her breast3 so much
the more he tires her raving mouth, tames her wild
heart, and moulds her by constraint. And now the
hundred mighty mouths of the house have opened of
their own will, and bring through the air the seer's
re il =' :

183& O thou that at last hast fulsilled the great perils
of the sea—yet by land more grievous woes await
thee—into the realm of Lavinium the sons of Dar-
danus shall coine—relieve thy heart of this care—
yet they shall not also joy in their coming. Wars,
grim wars Ι see, and Tiber foaming with streams of
blood. A Simois thou shalt not lack, nor a Xanthus,l
nor a Doric camp. Even now another Achilles2 is
raised up in Latium, he, too, goddess-born; nor shall
Juno anywhere fail to dog the 'l‘rojans, whilst thou,
a suppliant in thy need, what rac-es, what cities of
Italy shalt thou not implore ! The cause of all this
Trojan woe is again an alien bride, again a foreign
marriage l ³ Yield not thou to ills, but go forth to face
them more boldly than thy Fortune shall allow thee 14
Thy path of safety shall first, little as thou deemest it,
be opened from a Grecian city.'’ ⁵

⁹3 In such words the Cumaean Sibyl chants from
the shrine her dread enigmas and echoes from the¹
cavern, wrapping truth in darkness-——so does Apollo
shake the reins as she rages, and ply the spur
beneath her breast. Soon as the frenzy ceased

beart advance to meet it, by such rond as thy Destiny shall ’

allow thee’') is apparently a corruption in Seneca, who inter-
prets the passage as it he read quam.

Rome.
