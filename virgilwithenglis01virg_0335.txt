AENEID BOOK II

wiles and forced tears—we whom neither the son of
Tydeus nor Achilles of Larissa laid low, not ten years,
not a thousand ships!

1⁹⁹ “ Hereupon another portent, more fell and more
frightful by far, is thi‘ust upon us, unhappy oneS‚ and
confounds oui· unforeseeing souls. Laocoo'n, priest of
Neptune, as drawn by lot, was slaying agi-eat bull at
the wonted altars; and lo! from Tenedos, over the
peaceful depths—I shudder as I tell the tale—a pair of
sei-pents with endless coils are breasting the sea and
side by side making for the shore. Their bosonis
rise amid the sui-ge, and their crests, blood-red, over-
top the waves; the rest of them skims the main
behind and their huge backs curve in many a fold3
we hear the sound sent from foaming seas, And now
they were gaining the fields and, with blazing eyes
suffused with blood and fire, were licking with quiver-
ing tongues their hissing mouths Pale at the sight,
we scatter. They in unswerving course fare towards
Laocoen ; and first each serpent enfolds in its embrace
the youthful bodies of his two sons and with its faugs

ι feeds upon the hapless limbs. Then himself too, as
3 he eomes to their aid, weapons in hand, they seize
Q and bind in mighty folds; and now, twice encircling

his waist, twice winding their scaly backs around his
throat, they tower above with head and lofty necks.

Ἰ He the while sti-ains his hands to burst the knots, his
ζ fillets steeped in gore and black venum ; the while he
ξ lifts to heaven hideous eries, like the bellowings of

a wounded bull that has fled from the altar and

’Τ shaken from its neck the ill-aimed axe. But,

gliding away, the dragon pair escape to the losty
shrines, and seek fieree Tritonia’s eitadel, there
to nestle under the goddess’ feet and the circle of

her shield.
