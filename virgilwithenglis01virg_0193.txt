GEORGICS BOOK 111

¹5⁷ After birth, all care passes to the calves, and
at once they brand them with the mark and name of
the stoek, setting apart those they wish to rear for
breeding, to keep sacred for the altar, to set to cleave
the soil and turn up the field, rough with its broken
clods. The rest of the kine graze in the green
pastures; but such as you will shape for the farm’s

Then let them now draw empty carts oft-times over
the land, and print their trac-ks on the surface of the
dust. Later, let the beechen axle creak and strain
under its heavy lond and a brass-bound pole drag the

waters, and in Jupiter's grove2 to drive the flying
car, then the steed’s first task is to view the arnis of
gallant warriors, to bear the ’erumpet-eall, to endure
the groaning of the dragged wheel, and to hear the
jingle of bits in the stall; then more and more to
delight in his trainer's caressing praise, and to love the
