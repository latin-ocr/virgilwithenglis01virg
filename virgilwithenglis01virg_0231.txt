willow-hook.1 Let him, 'to whom such 6316 falls, him-
self bring thyme and wild 131116152 from high 11101111-
131115, and plant them widely round their homes ; 111111-
self harden his hand with stern toil; himself plant in
the ground fruitful slips and sprinkle kindly showers.

1¹⁶ And in truth, w·e1e Ι 1101 now hard on the
very close of my 10115, furling rmy sails, and hastening
to turn my prow to land, pei-chance, too, I might
be singing what careful tillage decks rich gardens,
singing of the rose-beds of twice-blooming Ρ365111111 ;
how the endive rejoiees in the 511631115 11 (11111115, and
the green banks in the parsley; and how the gom-(l,
winding along the ground, swells into its paunch.
Nor had I been silent on the late-blooming narcissus,
or the curling acanthus-stem, the pale ivy or 1116
shore-loving myrtle. For Ι 6311 to mind how under
the towers of Oebalia's citadel‚3 where dark Galaesus
waters his yellow fields, l saw 311 old Corycian, who
had 3 few 36165 of unclaimed land, and this a soil
not rich enough for bullocks’ ploughing, unfitted for
the flock, and unkindly to the vine. Yet, as he
planted herbs here and there among the bushes,
with white 111165 about, and vervum, and slendei·
poppy, he matched in contentment the wealth of
kings, and, returning home in the late evening,
would load 1115 boui-d with unbought dainties. He
was first 10 pluck ⁴roses in spring and apples iu
autumn; aud when 51111611 winter was still bursting
rocks with 1116 60111, 311(1 curbing running waterss
with ice, he was already culling the soft hyacinth’s
bloom, chiding laggard summer and 1116 loitering

'⁴ The tinus is described by Philargyrius as 3 wild laurel with
dark 111116 bei-ries. Itis possibly the laurustinus of our gai-dens,
a great favourite with bees, but in 110 way related to the true
laurels. ³ zze. Tarentum, founded by Laconians.
