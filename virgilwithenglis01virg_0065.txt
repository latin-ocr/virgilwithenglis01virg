ς my chief care, making the feast merry with wine—
1 111 winter, before the 11631111; 111 harvest· time, in the

shade—-I will pour from goblets 1116 fresh 1166131· of
{Chian wine. Damoetas ind Lyctian Aegon shall sing
{rso me, and Alphesiboeus 111111116 1116 dancing Satyrs

,1 purify our fields. Long as the boar lov es 1116 moun-
a. tain ridgeS, as the fish the streams3 long as the bees
seed on thyme and the cicalas on dew, so long shall

f thy honour and name and glories abide. As 1ο

ζ 1116 husbandmen pay 111611·ν’;0113 thou, too, shalt

ζ bind 1116111 to their vows.”

MOPSUS

But do you, Menalcas, take this crook, which
s Antigenes won not, often as he begged it of

{ove—a goodly crook, with even knots and ring of
)ronze.
