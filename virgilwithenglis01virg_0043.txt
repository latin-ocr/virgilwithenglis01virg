DAMOETAS

Did Ι not beat him in sfflging, and was he not to
pay me the goat my pipe had won by its songs? If
you must know, that goat was mine3 Damon himself
owned to it, but said he could not pay.

MENALCAS

You beat him in singing? Why, did you ever own
a wax-jointed pipe? Was it not you, Master Dunee,
who at the cross-roads used to murder a sorry tune
on a scrannel straw?

DAMOETAS

Well, would you have us try together, turn about,
what each can do? I’ll stake this cow. Now, don't
draw back! She comes twice a day to the milk-ing-
pail, and suckles two calves. Now tell me, for what
stake you will match me.

MENALCAS

From the herd l’d dare not stake anything with
you. I have at home a harsh father and stepmother ;
and twice a day both count the floek, and one of them
the kids as well. But—and you will yourselfown it for
a far greater wager—since you are on folly bent, I will
stake two beechen cups, the embossed work of divine
Alcimedon. On these a pliant vine, laid 011 by the
graver's skill, is entwined with spreading clusters of
pale ivy. In the midst are two figures, Conon and-—
who was the other,1 who marked out with his rod
the whole heavens for man, what seasons the reaper
should claim, what the stooping ploughman? Nor have
Ι yet put my lips to them, but keep them in store.

¹ The other astronomer was probably Eudoxus of Cnidus
whose Phaenomena was versified by Aratus.
