GEORGICS BOOK 111

1⁰3 See you not, when in headlong contest the
chal-iots have seized upon the plain, and stream
in a torrent from the barrier, when the young
drivers’ hopes are high, and throbbing fear drains each
bounding beart ? On they press with circling lash,
bending forward to slacken 1·ein; fier-cely flies the
glowing wheel. Now sinking low, now raised alost,
they seem to be borne through empty air and to soar
skyward. No rest, no stay is there 3 but a cloud of
yellow sand mounts aloft, and they are wet with the
foam and the breath of those in pursuit: so strong

taught the horseman, in full armour, to gallop over
the earth and round his proud paces. Equal is either
task ; 1 equally the trainers seek out a young steed,
hot of spirit and keen in the raee, though oft that

the time draws near, and take all heed to fill out with
firm flesh him whom they have chosen as leader and
assigned as lord of the herd. They cut him flowering
grasses, and give fresh water and corn, that he may
be more than equal to the seductive toil, and no feeble
offspring may repeat the leanness of the sires. But
the mares themselves they purposely make spare,
and when now the familiar pleasure first prompts

³ Referring probably to the contest between Neptune
(Poseidon) and Minerva (Athena). See Geor. 1. 12.
