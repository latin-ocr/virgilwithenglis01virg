AENEID BOOK V

does Acestes refuse his bidding. They enrol the
matrons for the town, and set on shore the folk who
wish it so—-souls with no eraving for high renown.
They themselves renew the thwarts, and replace the
fire-charred timbers of the ships, and fit up oars and
rigging—scant of number, but 3 brave band alive for
war. Meanwhile Aeneas marks out the city with 3
plough and allots homes3 this he bids be Ilium and
these lands Troy. Trojan Acestes delights in his
kingdom, proclaims 3 court, and gives laws to the
assembled senate. Then, on the erest of Eryx, 3
shrine, nigh to the stars, is founded to Venus of
Idalia, and to Anchises' tomb is assigned 3 priest
with breadth of hallowed grove.

⁷⁶2 And now for nine days all the folk have
feasted and offerings been paid at the altars3 gentle
winds have lulled the seas, and the South, breath-
ing oft upon thern, calls again to sea. Along the
winding shore arises 3 mighty wail 3 embracing one
another, they linger a night and a day. Now the
very mothers, the very men to whom once the face of
the sea seemed cruel and its name intolerable, are
fain to go out and bear all toil of exile. These good
Aeneas comforts with kindly words, and commends
with tears to his kinsman Acestes. 'I'hen he bids
slay three steers to Eryx and a lamb to the
Tempests‚ and duly loose the moorings. He him-
self, with temples bound in leaves of trimmed olive,
standing apart on the prow, holds the cup, flings the
enti-ails into the salt flood, and pours the liquid wine.
A wind, rising astem, attends them on their way,
and with rival strokes his comrades lash the sea and

sweep the waters.
