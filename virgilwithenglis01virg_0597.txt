AENE1D BOOK VI

⁸8⁶ Thus, through the whole region, they freely
range, in the broad,misty plains, surveyiug all. And
when Anchises had led his son over every scene, and
fired his sou] with love of fame that was to be, he
tells him then of the wars he must thereafter wage,
and instructs him of the Laurentiue peoples and
the city of Latinus, and how he is to flee or face
each toil.

⁸93 Two gates of Sleep there are, whereof the one
is said to be of horn, and thereby an easy outlet is
given to t1 ue shades; the other gleaming with the
sheen of polished ivory, but false ale the dreams
sent by the spilits to ’che world above. There then
with these words Anchises attends both his son and
the Sibyl, and dismisses them by the ivory gate.
Aeneas speeds his way 'co the ships and revisits his
comrade53 then straight along the shore sails sor
Caieta’s haven. The ane-hor is cast from the prow ;
the sterns rest upon the beach.
