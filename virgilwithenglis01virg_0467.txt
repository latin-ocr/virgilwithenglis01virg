AENEID BOOK IV

and unsheathes the Dardan sword, 3 gift besought
for no such end ! Then, as she saw the Trojan garb
and the familiar bed, pausing awhile 111 tearful
thought, she threw herself on the conch and spoke
1161 latest words:

‘³51 “O relies once dear, while God and Fate
allowed! take my spirit, and release me srom my
woes! I have lived, Ι 113ν6 finished the course that
Fortune gave; and now in majesty my shade shall
pass beneath the earth. A noble city I have built;
my own walls I have seen3 avenging my husband,
I have exacted punishment from my brother and
foe—happy, ah! too happy, had but the Dardan
keels never touched our sho1·es!’' She spoke, and
burying her face in the couch, “I shall die un-
avenged,'' she eries, “but let me die! Thus, thus
I go gladly into the darkl Let the cruel Dardan's
eyes drink 111 this fire from the deep, and carry with
him the omen of my death ! ’¹

maids see her fallen on the sword, the blade reeking
with blood and her hands bespattered. A scream
11565 to the lofty roof; Rumour riots through the
startled city. The palace rings with lamentation,
with sobbing and women's shrieks, and heaven echoes
with lond wails—even as though all Carthage or
ancient Tyre were falling before the inrushing foe,
and fierce flames were rolling on over the roofs of
men, over the roofs of gods. Swooning, her sister
heard, and in dismay rushed through the throng,
tearing her face with her 113115, and beating her
breast with her fists, as 5116 called on the dying
woman by name. “ Was this thy purpose, sister?
Didst thou aim thy fraud at me? Was this for me
the meaning of thy pyre, this of thy altar and fires ?
