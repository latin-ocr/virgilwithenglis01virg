AENEID BooK VI

²82 In the midst an ehn, shadowy and vast, spreads
her boughs and aged arms, the home which, men
say, false Dreams hold in throngs, clinging under
every leaf. And many monstrous forms besides of
various beasts are stalled at the doors, Centaurs and
double-shaped Scyllas, and the hundredfold Briareus,
and the beast of Lerna, hissing horribly, and the
Chimaera armed with flame, Gorgons and Harpies',
and the shape of the three-bodied shade.¹ Here on a
sudden, in trembling terror, Aeneas grasps his sword‚
and turns the naked edge against their coming3 and
did not his wise companion warn him that these
were but faint, bodiless Iives, flitting under a hollow
semblance of form, he had rushed upon them and
vainly clef’c shadows with the steel.

²⁹5 Hence a road leads to the waters of Tartaream
Acheron. Here, thick with mire and of fathomless
flood, a whirlpool seethes and belches into Cocytus all
its saud. A grim warden ² gual-ds these waters and
streams, terrible in his squalor—Charon, on whose
chin lies a mass of unkempt, hoaly hair3 his eyes
are staring orbs of flame3 his squalid gal-b hangs by a
knot from his shoulders. Unaided, he poles the boat,
tends the sails, and in his mul-ky craft convoys the
dead—now aged, but a god's old age is hardy and
green. Hither rushed all the wrong, streaming to
the banks; mothers and men aud bodies of high-
souled heroes, their life now done, boys and unwedded
girls, and sons placed on the pyre before their
fathers' eyes; thick as the leaves of the forest that
at autumn’s first frost dropping fall, and thick as the

have acted as a ferryman, as Charon certainly does, and the
idea that he was primax-ily a ferryman was probably furthered
by the resemblance of the word to portare. After virgil the
original meaning faded away.
