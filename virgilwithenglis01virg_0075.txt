Taya-<18

Shepherds of Arcady, crown with ivy your rising
bard, that Codrus’ sides may burst with envy3 or,
y should he praise me unduly, wr< athe my brow with
ς foxglove‚ lest his evil tongue harm the bard that
ῑ is to be.l
÷ CORYDON

To thee, Delia, young Micon offers this head ofa
ὲ bristling boar aud the branching antlers of a long-
= lived stag. If this fortune still abides, thou shalt
ξ stand full length in polished marble, thy ankles bound
ξ high with purple buskins.

THYRSIS

A bow] of milk, Priapus, and these cakes, are all
thou canst expect year by year; the garden thou
’ watchest is poor. Now we have made thee of marble
ς for the time3 but if births make full the flock,
ξ then be thou of gold.

CORYDON

Galatea, child of Nereus, sweeter to ule than
Hybla's thyme, whiter than swans, lovelier than pale
ivy, soon as the bulls come back from pastore to the
¹ stalls, if thou hast any love for thy Corydon, come
Ἰ hither!

Tnvnffls

Nay, let me seem to thee more bitter than Sar-
ἶ dinian herbs, more rough than gorse, more worthless
² than upcast seaweed‚ if even now I find not this day
ἱ longer than a whole year. Go home, my well-fed
μ steers, if ye have any shame, go home ἱ
