AENEID BOOK VI

toilsome way? Is it given me to see thy face, my
son, and hear and utter familiar tones ? Even so I
mused and deemed the hour would come, counting
the days ther-eto, nor has my yearning failed me.
O’er what kinds, what wide seas hast thou journeyed
to my welcome! What dangers have tossed thee,
O my son 1 How Ι feared the realm of Libya might
work thee harm ! ’'

⁶⁹⁵ But he: “Thy shade, father, thy sad shade,
meeting me so oft, drove me to seek these portals.
My ships ride the Tuscan sea. Grant me to elasp
thy hand, grant me, O father, and withdraw thee
not from my embrace 1 ’'

⁶⁹9 So he spolie, his face wet with flooding tears.
Thrice there he strove to throw his arms about his neck;
thrice the form, vainly clasped, fled from his hands,
even as light winds, and most like a winged dream.

⁷⁰3 Meanwhile, in a retired vale, Aeneas sees a se-
questered grove and rustling forest thiekets‚ and the
river of Lethe drifting past those peaceful homes.
About it hovered peoples and tribes unnumbered;
even as when, in the meadows, in eloudless summer-
time, bees light on many-hued blossoms and stream
round lustrous lilies and all the fields murmur with
the humming. Aeneas is thrilled by the sudden
sight and, knowing not, asks the cause—what is
that river yonder, and who are the men thronging
the banks in such a host? Then father Anchises:
‘·' Spirits they are, to whom second bodies are owed
by Fate, and at the water of Lethe’s stream they
drink the soothing draught and long forgetfulneSS.
These in truth Ι have long yearned to tell and show
thee to thy face, yea, to count this, my children⁷s
seed, that so thou mayest rejoice with me the more
at finding Italy.’'
