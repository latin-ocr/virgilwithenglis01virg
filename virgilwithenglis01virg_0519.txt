AENEID BOOK V

escape the flame even now, Ο Father, and snatch
from doom the slender fortunes of the Trojans! Or
if Ι deserve it, do thou with levelled thunderbolt send
down to death the little that remains, and here over-
whelm us with thy hand.¹' Scarce had he uttered
this when with streaming showers a black tempest
rages unrestrained3 with thunder tremble hills
and plains3 from the whole sky down rushes a
fierce storm of rain, pitch-black with laden south
winds. The ships are filled to overflowing‚ the
half—burnt timbers are soaked‚ till all the heat is
quenched, and all the hulls save four are rescued
from the plague.

⁷⁰⁰ But father Aeneas, stunned by the bitter blow,
now this way, now that, within his heart shifted
mighty cares, pondering whether, forgetful of fate,
he should settle in Sicilian fields, or aim to reach
Italian coasts. Then aged Nautes, whom, above all,
Tritonian Pallas taught, and with deep lore made
famous—she it was who gave him answers, telling
either what the mighty wrath of the gods portended,
or what the course of fate demanded—he with these
words essays to comfort Aeneas: “Goddess-born,
whither the Fates,in their ebb and flow, draw us, let us
follow ; whatever befall, all fortune is to be o’ercome
by bearing. Thou hast Trojan Acestes, of divine
stock3 him take to share thy counsels, a willing
pai-tner3 to him entrust those who, their ships thus
lost, are left over, and those who have grown aweary
of thy great emprise and of thy fortunes. Choose out
the old men full of years and sea-worn matrons, and
all of thy company who are weak and fearful of peril,
and grant that the wearied find their city in this
land. This town, so thou allow the name, they shall
call Acesta.’'
