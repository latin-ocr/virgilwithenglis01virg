EDITIONS AND COMMENTARIES

THE editio princeps appeared in Rome (probably 1409).
Of subsequent editions the most important are those
of Heinsius (1664—88)‚ Heyne (1767—75, *lth ed. by
Wagner, 1830-41), Ribbeck (1859-68)‚ Fon-biger
(1872-75), Benoist (1876), Thilo (1886), Hit-tzel
(Clai'endon Press, 1900). Complete annotated edi-
tions in English are by Kennedy (1879), Conington
(completed and revised by Nettleship‚ lst vol. re-
edited by Haverfield, 1881-83), Papillon (1889),
Sidgwick (1890), Page (1900-9), and, in Amet-ica,
Greenough and Kitt1·edge (with a complete vocabu-
lary, 1899). Partial editions in various languages are
very numerous, the most conspicuous of recent years
being E. Norden's Aeneid, Book γι, with German
commentary and translation (1903).1

The ancient commentary of Servius (fourth cen-
tury) was printed as early as 1471, and is given in
several editions of Virgil.2 It is edited separately by
Lion (1826) and by Thilo and Hagen (1878 sqq.)

¹ Certain (lisputed passages are dismissed by the translator
in the Fairclough-Brown edition of tho Aemid, Books 1—V1
(Sanborn and Co„ Boston: latest reprint 1925), and in the
Transactions ancl Prooemium of the American Philoloqical
Association for 1907, vol. 38, pp. xxxvi ff.

2 Besides Servius, occasion-<il references are made in the
notes to the grammarians, Nonius, Charisius, Donatus, and
Philargyrius.
