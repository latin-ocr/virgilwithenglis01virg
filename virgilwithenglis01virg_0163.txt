GEORGICS BOOK 11

not merely that the view may feed an idle fancy, but
because only thus will the earth give equal strength
to all, and the boughs be able to reach forth into free
air.

²88 Perchance you ask also what should be the
trenches' depth. I should venture to entrust 3 vine
even to a shallow furi-mv, but deeper and far within
the earth is sunk the supporting tree, above all the
great oak, which strikes its roots down towards the
nether pit as far as it lifts its top to the airs of heaven.
Hence no winter storms, no blasts or rains, uproot it ;
unmoved it abides, and many generations, many ages
of men it outlives, letting them roll by while it en-
dures. Stout limbs, too, and arms it stretches far,
this side and that, itself in the centre upholding a

¹ mass of shade.

29⁸ Let not your vineyards slope towards the

τ’ Setting sun, nor plant the hazel among the vines, nor
lop the highest sprays, nor pluek cuttings from the

tree-top—so strong is their love of the earth—
nor hurt young plants with a blunted knife, nor en-
graft wild trunks of olive.l For oft from thoughtless
Shepherds falls 3 spark, which, lurking at first nnseen
under the rich bark, fastens on the trunk, and, gliding
to the leaves alost, sends to heaven 3 mighty roar3
then, running on, reigns supreme among all the
boughs and high tree-tops, wrapping all the grove in
fire, and belching skyward black clouds of thick
pitehy darkness3 most of all, if a tempest from above
has swooped down upon the woods, and 3 favouring
wind masses the flames. then this befalls, the trees

. are without virtue in their stock, and when cut down

cannot revive or from the earth's depths resume their

vines as supports. This implies that the subject of valent
(l. 312) is vices.
