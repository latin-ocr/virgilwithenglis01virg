AENEID BOOK I

attentive ears; he with speech sways their passion
and soothes their brcastzt even so, all the roar of
ocean sank, soon as the Sim, looking forth upon the
waters and driving under a clear sky, guides his
steeds and, flying onward, gives reins to his willing

¹5⁷ The wearied sons of Aeneas1 strive to run for the
nearest shore and 'curn towards the coast of Libya.
There in a deep inlet lies a spot, where an island forms
a harbour with the barrier of its sides, on which ever)v
wave from the main is broken, then parts into reced-

cliffs and twin peaks, bene-ath whose erest far and
wide is the stillness of sheltered water3 above, too,
is a background of shimmering woods with an over-
hanging grove, black with gloomy shade. Under the
brow of the fronting cliff is a cave of hanging rocks 3
within are fresh waters and seats in the living stone,
a haunt of Nymphs, Here no fetters imprison weary
ships, no anchor holds them fast with hooked bite.
Here, with seven ships mustered from all his fleet,
Aeneas takes shelter; and, disembarking with earnest
longing for the land, the Trojans gain the welcome
bench and strete-h their brine-drenched linibs upon
the shore. At once Achates struck a spark from
flint, caught the fire in leaves, laid ‹lry fuel about, and
waved the flame amid the tinder.³ Then, wearied
with their lot, they take out the corn of Ceres, spoiled
¹ by the waves, with the tools of Ceres, and prepare
, to [ναι-(3111110 rescued grain in the fire and crush it

’ under the stone.
