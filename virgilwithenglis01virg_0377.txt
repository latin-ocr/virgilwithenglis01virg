1110 work begun, and 10 the high king of the lords of
heaven was slaying a shining white bull upon the
shore. By chance, hard by there was a mound, on
whose top were cornel bushes and myrtles bristling
with crowded spear-8hafts. Ι drew near ; and essaying
to tear up the green growth from the soil, that I might
deck the altar with leafy boughs, Ι 500 311 awsul

which is torn from 1110 ground with broken 10015, drops
of black blood trickle and stain the 031111 with gore.

blood freezes with terror. Once more, from a second
also I go on 10 pluck a tough 511001 and probe deep
the hidden cause; from the bark of the second also
follows black blood. Pondering much in heart, I
prayed 1110 woodland Nymphs, and father Gradivus,
