among mortals, pity such distress3 pity a soul that
bears sorrow undeserved l ’

14⁵ “To these tears we grant life and pity him
besides. Priam himself first bids his fetters and
tight bonds be removed, and thus speaks with words
of kindness:

143 “ ‘ Whoever thou art, from henceforth forget
the Greeks thou hast lost3 thou shalt be ours. And
explain to me truly this that I ask. To what
end have they set up this huge mass of a horse?
Who is the contriver? or what is their aim?
What religious offering is it ? or what engine of war Ρ ’
He ceased; the other, schooled in Pelasgian guile

' and craft, lifted to the stars his unfettered hands:
, ‘ Ye, O everlasting fires‚’ he eries, ‘ and your invio-
ἐ lable majesty, be ye my witness; ye, O altars, and
ζ accursed swords which I escaped, and chaplets of

the gods, which I wore as victim¹ rightly may Ι
break my solemn obligations to thc Greeks, rightly
hate them and bring all things to light if they hide
aught; nor am I bound by any laws of country.
Only ‹lo thou, O Troy, stand by thy promises and,
preserved thyself, preserve thy faith, if my tidings
prove true—2 ifI shall make a large return ἔ

²⁶² “ ‘ All the hope of the Danaans and their con-
fidence in beginning the war were ever stayed on
the help of Pallas. But from the time that the un-
godly son of Tydeus ¹ and Ulysses, the contriver of

,v crime, dai-ed to tear the fateful Palladium from its
ἶὶ hallowed shrine, slew the guards of the citadel-
ἓξ height, and, snatching up the sacred image, ventured
ζ with bloody hands to touch the fillets of the maiden
! goddess—from that time the hopes of the Danaans

ebbed and, backward stealing,1·eceded 3 their strength
was broken and the heart of the goddess estranged.
