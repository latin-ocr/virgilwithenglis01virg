ECLOGUE Ι

TITYRUS

What was I to do? I could not quit my slavery
nor elsewhere find my gods so ready to aid. Here,
Meliboeus, I saw that youth for whom our altars
smoke twice six days a year. Here he was the first
to give my plea an answer: “Feed, swains, your
oxen as of old3 rear your bulls.'’ '

MELIBOEUS

Happy old man! So these lands will still be
yours, and large enough for you, though bare stones
cover all, and the marsh chokes your pastures with
slimy rushes. Still, no strange herbage shall try
your breeding ewes, no baneful infection from a
neighbour's flock shall harm them. Happy old
man! Here, amid familiar streams and sacred
springs, you shall court the cooling shade. On this
side, as aforetime, on your neighbour’s border, the
hedge whose willow blossoms are sipped by Hybla’s
bees shall often with its gentle hum soo'che you to
slumber3 on that, under the towering rock, the
woodman’s song shall fill the air; while still 'che
cooing wood-pigeons, your pets, and the turtle-dove
shall cease not their moaning from the skyey elm.

TITYRUS

Sooner, then, shall the nimble stag graze in air,
and the seas leave their fish bare on the strand—
sooner‚ each wandering over the other's frontiers‚
shall the Parthian in exile drink the Arar, and
Germany the Tigris, than that look of his shall fade
from my heart.
