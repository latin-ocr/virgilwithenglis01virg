AENEI D BOOK I

1⁸⁰ Meanwhile Aeneas climbs a peak and seeks a
full view far and wide over the deep, if he may but
see aught of storm-tossed Antheus and his Phrygi-an
ἶ(3111111ογ5, or of Capys or the arms of Caicus on the high
stern. Ship in sight there is none; three stags he
descries straying on the shore3 whole herds follow
these behind and in long line graze adown the valley.
Thereon he stopped and seized in his hand his bow
and swift arrows, the arms borne by faithful Achates 3
ει·“(1 first he lays low the leaders themselves, their
heads held high with branching antlers, then routs
the herd and all the common sort, driving them with
his darts amid the leasy woods Nor does he stay
his hand till seven huge forms he stretches victo-
riously on the ground, equal in number to his ships.
Then he seeks the harbour and divides them among
all his company. Next he shares the wine, which
good Acestes had stowed in jars on the Trinacriam
shore, and hero-like had given at parting3 and,
speaking thus, calms their sorrowing hearts:

1⁹⁸ “O comrades—for ere this we have not been
ignorant of evils—O ye who have borne a heavier
lot, to this, too, God will grant an end! Ye drew
near to Scylla’s fury and her deep-echoing crags3 ye
have known, too, the rocks of the Cyclopes; recall

ι your courage and put away sad fear. Perchance
¹ even this distress it will some day be a joy to recall.
¹ Through divers mishaps, through so many perilous
,ἶ chances, we fare towards Latium, where the fates
ξ point out a home of rest. There ’tis granted to Troy's
j realm to rise again3 endure, and keep yourselves for
ζ days of happiness.”

2⁰3 So spakc his tongue; while sic-k with weighty

, cares he feigns hope on his face, and deep in 1115

f, heart stilles the anguish. The others make ready for
