‘²1⁶ “ Anna, thou seest the bustle all along the
shore ; from all sides they have gathered 3 already the
canvas courts the breeze‚ and the joyous sailors have
crowned the sterns with garlands. If Ι have had
strength to foresee this great sorrow, Ι shall also,
sister, have strength to endure it. Yet this one
service, Anna, do for me—for thee alone that traitor
made his friend, to thee he confided even his secret
thought5‚ alone thou knowest the hour for easy access
to him—go, sister, and humbly address our haughty
foe. Ι never conspired with the Danaans at Aulis to
root out the Trojan race; 1 never sent a fleet to Per-
gamus, nor uptore the ashes and spirit of his father
Anchises.1 Why refuses he to admit my words to
his stubborn ears? Whither does he hasten? This,
the last boon, let him grant his poor lover: let him
await an easy ssight and favoni-ing winds. No more
do Ι plead for the old marriage-tie which he for-
swore, nor that he give up fair Latium and resign his
realm: for empty time 1 ask, for peace and reprieve
for my srenzy, till fortune teaeh my vanquished soul
to grieve. This last grace Ι orave—pity thy sister—-
and when he has granted it I will repay with full
interest in my death.'’

the unhappy sister bears again and again. But by
no tearful pleas is he moved, nor in yielding mood
pays he heed to any words. Fate withstands and
heaven seals his kindly‚ mortal ears. Even as when
northern Alpine winds, blowing now hence, now
thence, emulously strive to uproot an oak strong
