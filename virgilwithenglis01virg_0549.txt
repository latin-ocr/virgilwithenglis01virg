AENEID BOOK VI

the flame died away, they washed with wine the
remnant of ’chii-shy dust, and Corynaeus, gathering
the bones, hid them in a brazen urn. He, too, with
pure water thrice encircled his eorm-ades and
cleansed them, sprinkling light dew from a fruitful
olive—bough, and spake the words of farewell. But
good Aeneas heaps over him a massive tomi), with
the soldier’s own arms, his oar and trumpet, be-
neath a lofty mount, which now from him is called
Misenus, and keeps from age to age an ever-living
name.

behest. A deep cave there was, yawning wide and
vast, shingly, and sheltered by dai-k lake and wood-
land gloom, over which no flying creatures could
safely wing their way3 such a vapour from those
blac-k jaws poured into the over-arching heaven
[whence the Greeks spoke of Avernus, the Birdless
place} Here first the priestess set in line four dark-
backed heifers, and pours wine upon their brows;
then, plucking ’che topmost bristles from between the
hol-ns, lays them on the sacred fire for first offer-ing,
calling aioud on Hecate, supreme both in Heaven
and in Heil. Others set knives to the throat and
catch the warm blood in bowls. Aeneas himself
slays with the sword a black-fleeced lamb to the
mother1 of ’che Eumenides and her great sister, and
to thee, O Proserpine, a barren heifer. Then for the
Stygian king² he inaugurates an altar by night, and
lays upon the flames whole carcasses ofbulls, pom-ing
fat oil over the blazing entrails. But lo! hard upon
the dawning light of the early sun the ground

Chaos.
