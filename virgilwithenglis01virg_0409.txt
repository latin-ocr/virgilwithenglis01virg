AENEID BOOK 111

Epirus, in Hesperia—who have the same Dardanus
for ancestor and the same disastrous story—of these
twain we shall make one Troy in spirit. May that
charge await our children's children l ’ ¹

⁵⁰⁶ “ Along the sea we speed, by the near Ceraunian
cliffs,whence is the way to Italy and the shortest voyage
over the waves. Meanwhile the sun sets and the hills
lie dark in shade. Having allotted the oars, we fling
ourselves down near the water on the bosom of the
welcome land and refresh ourselvcs on the dry beach ;
sleep bedews our weary limbs. Nor yet was Night‚
driven by the Hours, entering her mid course, when
Palinurus springs, alert‚ from his couch, tries all
the winds, and with eager ear catches the breeze; he
marks all the stars gliding in the silent sky, Arcturus,
the rainy Hyades, and the twin Rem-s, and 116 scans
Orion, girt with goldcn armour. When he sees that
all is calm in a cloudless sky, he gives a loud signal
from the stern3 we break up camp, venture on our
way, and spread the wings of our sails. And now
the stars were put to rout and Dawn was blushing,
when far off we see dim hills and low-lying Italy.
‘Italy !' first Achates shouts aloud3 Italy the crews
hail with joyful cry. Then father Anchises wreathed
a great bowl, filled it with wine, and standing on
the lofty stern called on the gods: ‘ Ye gods, lords
of the sea and earth and storms, waft, us onward
with easy wind, and blow with favour-ing breath !'
The longed-for breezes freshen, a haven opens as we
now draw near, and a temple is seen on Minerva’s

Height.2 My conirades furl the sails and shoreward
