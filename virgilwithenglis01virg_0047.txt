MENALCAS

And me Phoebus loves3 Phoebus ever finds with

me the offerings he loves, laurels and sweet-blushing
hyacinths.

DA MOETAS

Galatea, saucy girl, pelts me with an apple, then
runs off to the willows--and hopes to be seen first.

MENALCAS

But my flame Amyntas comes to me unsought, so
that now Delia is not better known to my dogs.

DAMOETAS

Gifts Ι have found for my love3 for Ι have myselt
marked where the wood-pigeons have been building
high in the air.

MENALCAS

Ι have sent my boy—’twas all I could do—ten
golden apples, culled from a tree in the wood. To-
morrow I will send a second ten.

DAMOETAS

O the times and the things Galatea has spoken to
me ! Waf‘c some part, ye winds, to the ears of the gods.

MENALCAS

What boots it, Amyntas, that you yourself scorn
me not in heart, if, while you follow the boars, Ι
watch the nets?

o DAMOETAS

Send Phyllis to me3 it is my birthday, Iollas.

Wllgen Ι sacrifice a heiser for the harvest, come your-
se .
