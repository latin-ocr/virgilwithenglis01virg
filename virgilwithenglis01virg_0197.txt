woods or pastures3 nay, oft she drives her proud lovers
to settle their mutual contest with clash of horns. She
is grazing in Sila’s great forest, a lovely heifer: the
bulls in alternate onset join battle with mighty force3

horns, charges a tree's trunk3 he lashes the winds with
blows, and paws the sand in prelude for the fray.

and tosses black sand alost.
