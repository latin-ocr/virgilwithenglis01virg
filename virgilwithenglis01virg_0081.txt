DAMON

“ Rise, O morning star, heralding genial day,while
Ι, cheated in the love which my promised Nysa
spurned, make lanient, and, though their witnessing
has availed me naught, yet, as I die, I call on the
gods in this my latest hour.

Regin with me, myflute, a song of Maenalus Ι

Maenalus hath ever tuneful groves and speaking
pines; ever does he listen to shepherds’ loves and
to Pan, who first awoke the idle reeds.

Regin with me, my flate, a song of IIIaenalus!

To Mopsus is Nysa given ἔ For what may we lovers
not look ? Griffins now shall mate with mares, and,
in the age to come, the timid deer shall come with

hounds to drink.
Regin with me, my flate, μ song of Maenalus !

Mopsus, cut new torches ἔ For thee they bring the
bride! Scatter, bridegroom, the nuts! For thee

the Evening-star quits Oeta 2

Regin with me, myflute, α song of Blaenalus !
O wedded to a worthy lord! even while thou
scornest all men, and while thou hatest my pipe

and my goats, my shaggy eyebrows and unkempt
beard, and thinkest that no god ree-ks aught of the

deeds of men !
Regin with me, myflnle, (ι song ofstlaenalus
