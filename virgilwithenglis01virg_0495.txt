AENEID BOOK V

Yet not of Euryalus, not of his love was he forgetful ;
for as he rose amid the sodden ground he threw
himself in the way of Salius, who, rolling over, sell
prostrate on the clotted sand. Euryalus darts by and,
winning by grace of his friend, takes first place, and
flies on amid favouring applause and cheers. Behind
come Helymus, and Diores, now third prize.

34⁰ Hereupon Salius fills with loud clamour the
whole concourse of the great theatre and the gazing
elders in sront, claiming that the prize wrested from
him by fraud be given back. Goodwill befriends
Euryalus, and his seemly tem-s and worth, that shows
more winsome in a fair form. Diores backs him,1nal<ing
loud protest3 he has reached the palm, but in vain won
the last prize, if the highest honours be restored to
Salius. ‘l'hen said father Aeneas: “Your rewards
remain assured to you, my lads, and no oue alters the
prizes' order; be it mine to pity the mischance of a
hapless friend ! ” So saying, 116 gives 'co Salius the huge
hide of a Gaetulian lion, heavy with shaggy hair and
gilded claws. Then said Nisus: “ Ifsuch be the prize
for defeat, and thou hast pity for the fallen, what fit
reward wilt thou give Nisus ? The first crown Ι had
eal-ned by merit, had not Fortune's malice fallen
011 me, as 011 Salius.’' And with the words he
displayed his face and limbs foul with wet filth.
The gracious father smilcd on him and bade a
shield be brought out, the handiwork of Didymaon,
once taken down by Greeks from Neptune's hallowed
(1001·1ν1111.1 This 116 bestows on the noble youth, a
lordly prize.

¹ Aeneas had apparently captured this shield from a
Greek hero who, on setting out for Troy, had taken it

dgwn from the temple where it had been placed as a dedicated
