GEORGICS BOOK 111

special pains, even from their early youth. From the
first, the foal ofanoble breed steps higher in the fields
and brings down his feetlightly. Boldly he leads the
way, braves thr-eatening rivers, entrusts himself to an
untried bridge, and starts not at idle sounds. His
neck is high, his head clean-cut, his belly short, his
back plump, and his gallant chest is rich in muscles.
Good colours are hay and grey3 the worst, white and
dun. Again, should he but hear afar the clash of
arms, he cannot keep his place3 he pricks up his
ears, quivers in his limbs, and snorting rolls beneath
his nostrils the gathered fire. His mane is thick
and, as he tosses it, falls back on his right shoulder.
A double ridge runs along his loins; his hoof scoops
out the ground, and the solid horn gives it a deep
ring. Such was Cyllarus, tamed by the teins of
Amyclaean Pollux, and those whose fame Greek
poets recount, the two steeds of Mars,l and the pair
of the great Achilles.2 Such, too, was Saturn himself,
when at his wife's³ coming he fled swiftly, flinging
his horse's mane over his shoulders‚ and with shrill
neigh filled the heights of Pelion.

⁹⁵ Yet even such a steed, when, worn with disease or
sluggish through years, he begins to fail, shut up in-
doors and pity not his inglorious age. Cold is his passion
when old, vainly he strives at a thankless ton, and
whenever he comes to the fray his ardour is futile,
as in the stubble a great fire rages at times without
strength. Therefore note above all their spirit and
years; then, other merits and the stock of their sires,
the grief each shows at defeat or the pride in victory.
