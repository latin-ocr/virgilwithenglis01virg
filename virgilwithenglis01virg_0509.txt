in his grandsire's honour and show himself in arms.”
He himself bids all the streaming throng quit the
long course and leave the field clear. On come
the boys, and in even array glitter before their
fathers' eyes on bridled steeds3 as they pass by,
the men of Trinacria and Troy murmur in admira-
tion. All have their hair duly crowned with a
trimmed garland3 each carries two cornel spear-
shafts tipped with iron 3 some have polished quivers
on their shoulders3 high on the breast around the
neck passes a pliant circlet of twisted gold.1 Three
in number are the troops of horse, and three the
riding captains3 the boys, two groups of six following
each, look gay with parted troop and like com-
manders.2 One line of youths in triumphaljoy is led
by a little Priam, renewing his grandsire’s name——
thy noble seed, Polites, and destined to swell the
Italian racel Him a Thracian horse bears, dappled
with spots of white, showing white pasterns as it steps
and a white, high-towering brow. The second is
Atys, from whom the Latin Atii have drawn their
line—little Atys, a boy beloved of the boy Iulus.
Last, and in beauty excelling all, Itilus rode on a
Sidonian horse, that fairest Dido had given as memo-
rial of herself and pledge of her love. The rest of
the youth ride on the Siciliam steeds of old Acestes.

down on the neck.

² Thirty-six boys were divided into three companies
(turmae), which were commanded alike (paribus maglistris),
each having a captain (terni ductores). The ductores and the
'magistri are the same3 cf. 176 with 133. (The trainers,
however, are also called maqistri in 669,and of these Epytides
was the chief.) Each company, again, was subdivided into
two groups (chori) of six each.
