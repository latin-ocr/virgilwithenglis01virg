GEORGICS BOOK IV

zephyrs. So he, too, was first to be eni-iched with
mother-bees and a plenteous swarm, the first to gather
srothing honey from the squeezed eomb. Luxuriant
were his limes and wild laurels ; 1 and all the fruits
his bounteous tree donned in its early bloom, full as
many it kept in the ripeness of autumn. He, too,
planted out in rows elms far-grown, pear-trees when
quite hard, thoi-ns even now bearing plums, and the
plane already yielding to drinkers the service of its
shade.² But 1, barred by these nari-ow bounds, pass
by this theme, and leave it for others after me to tell.

14⁹ Come now, the qualities which Jove himself
has given bees, I will unfold—even the reward, for
which they followed the tuneful sounds and clashing
bronzes of the Curetes, and fed the king of Heaven
within the cave of Dicte.3 They alone have children
in common, hold the dwellings of their city jointly,
and pass their life under the majesty of law, They
alone know a fatherland and fixed home, and in
summer, mindful of the winter to come, spend toil-
some days and garner their gains into a common
store. For some watch over the gathering of food,
and under fixed covenant labour in the fields 3 some,
within the confines of their homes, lay down the
narcissus¹ tears and gluey gum from tree—bark as
the first foundation of the comb, then hang aloft
clinging wax ; others lead out the full-grown young,
the nation’s hope3 others pack purest honey, and
swell the cells with liquid nectar. To some it has
fallen by lot to be sentries at the gates, and in
turn they wateh the rains and clouds of heaven, or
take the loads of incomers, or in martial array drive

him, devoured them as they were born, but the infant Jupiter
was concealed by his mother in a cave of Mount Dicte, and the
Curetes drowned his eries by clashing their eymbals, while
the bees fed him with honey.
