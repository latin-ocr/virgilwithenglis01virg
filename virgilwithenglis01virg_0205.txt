GEORGICS BOOK ΙΙΙ

brought 1111151 10 all, and 1110 plaintive cic-alas rend the
thickets with song, I will bid the sim-ks at the side of
wells or deep pools drink of the water that runs in
oaken channels. But in midday heat let them seek
out a shady dell, where haplyJove’s mighty oak with
its ancient trunk 5110101105 out giant 111111101105, 01
where the grove, black with many 11011115, 1105 brooding
with hallowed shade. Then give them 01100111010 1110
trickling stream, and once more seed them 1111 sun-
set, when the 0001 evening-star allays the air, and the
moon, now dropping dew, gives strength to the glades,
when the 5110105 ring with the halcyon, and the 0011505
with 1110 1111011.

339 Why follow up sor you in song the 5110111101115
of Libya, their pastures, and the 50111011101115 where
they dwell in scattered huts? Osten, day and night,
and a whole month through, the floeks seed and roam
into the desert stretches, with no 51101101·5; so vast a
plain lies outstretched. The African herdsman takes
with him 1115 all-his house and home, his 311115, hi*
Spartan dog and Cretan quiver 1—-even as the valiant
Roman, when, arrayed in his country's arms, he hastes
011 1115 march under a cruel load, and, 010 1110 foe
awaits him, halts 1115 column and 111101105 liis camp.

34⁹ Far otherwise is 11 where dwell 1110 tribes of
Scythia by the waters of Maeotis, where the turbid
Danube 105505 1115 yellow samis, and where Rhodope
bends back, stretehing up to the centra] pole. There
they keep the herds penned up in stalls, and no blade
15 50011 1111011 the plain, or leaf upon the tree; but far
and wide earth lies shapeless under mounds of snow
and piles ofice, rising seven cubits high. 'Tis ever
winter3 ever North-west blasts, with icy brea'th.

¹ The epithets are merely ornamental, Spartan dogs and
Cretan archers being the most famous of their kind.
