LYCIDAS

By your pleas you put off my longing. Now the
whole sea-plain lies s’cill and silent, and lo! everv
breath of the murmuring breeze is dead. Just fron}
here lies half our journey, for Bianor‘s tomb is coming
into view. Here, where husbandmen are lopping the
thick leaves—here, Moeris, let us sing. Here put
down the kidssswe shall reach the town all the
same. Or if we sear that nig ht may first bring on
rain, we may yet& σο singing on our way—it makes
the road less iiksome. 'Ihat we may go singing
on our way, I will relieve you of this burden. ⁴

MOERIS

Say no more, la(l; let us to the task in hand. Oui·
songs we shall sing the better, when the master
himself is come.

Mv last 'cask tlxis—vouchsafe me it, Arethusa2! A
few xelses I must sing for my ΟιΙΙυς, yet such as
Lycolis herself may read! who would reiuse vex ιιεεε
to Gillus Ρ lf, when thou glides t beneath Sic-ssim
waves, thou wouldst not have briny Doris blend her
stream with thine, begin! Let us tell of Gallus'
anxious loves, while the blunt-noscd goats crop the
tender brakes. We sing to no (leaf ears; the woods

echo every note.

1 In this tenth Eologue the poet sings the love of his friend
C. Cornelius Gallus for a mistress who had deserted him.

The scene is laid in Arcadia.
² Invoked as a Sieilian Muse and inspirer of Theocritus.
