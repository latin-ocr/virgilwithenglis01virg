AENEID BOOK III

shalt look on an inspired p1·ophetess‚ who deep in 3
rocky cave sings the Fates and entrusts to leaves
signs and symbols. Whatever verses the maid 1133
traced 011 leavesl she arranges in order and stores
away in the cave. These remain unmoved in their
places and quit not their rank; but when at the
turn of the hinge a light breeze 1133 stirred them,
and the open door scattered the tender foliage, never
does she thereafter care to catch them, as they flutter
in the rocky cave, nor to recover their places, nor
to unite the verses; uncounselled, men depart, and
loathe the Sibyl’s seat. Here let no loss in delay
be of such account in thine eyes—though comrades
chide, though the voyage urgently calls thy sails to
the deep and thou mayest swell their folds with
favouring gales—that thou visit not the prophetess
and with prayers plead that she herself chant the
eracles, and graciously open her lips in speech. The
nations of Italy, the wars to come, the mode whereby
thou art to flee or face each toil, she will unfold to
thee3 and, reverently besought, she will grant thee
a prosperous voyage. This it is whereof by my voice
thou mayest be warned. Now go thy way, and by thy
deeds exalt Troy in greatness unto heaven !'

4⁶3 “ When the seer had thus spoken with friendly
lips, he next gives command that gifts of heavy gold
and sawn ivory be brought to the ships, stows in
the hulls massive silver and cauldrons of Dodona, a
breastplate trebly woven with hooks of gold, and a
brilliant pointed helm with crested plumes, the arms
of Neoptolemus. My father, too, has gifts of his own ;
horses he brings, and guides he brings ; he fills up our
crews, and with armS, too, equips my comrades.
