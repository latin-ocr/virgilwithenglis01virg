AENEID BOOK V

⁵⁷⁰ The Dardanians greet the bashful boys with
cheers and rejoice as they gaze, seeing in them the
features of their sires of old ''ellhen the lads had
ridden gaily round the whole circuit of their gazing
kinsfolk, Epytides shouted from afar the looked-for
signal and cracked his whfp. They galloped apart
in equal ranks, and the three companies, parting their
bands, broke up the columns; then recalled, they
wheeled about and charged with levelled lanceS.l
Next they enter on other marolles and other counter-
marches in opposing groups,interweaving circle with
alternate circle, and waking an armed mimicry of
battle. And now they bare their backs in ssight,
now turn their spears in charge, now make peace
and ride on side by side. As of old in high Crete
'tis said the Labyrinth held a path woven with
blind walls, and a bewildering work of craft with
a thousand ways, where the tokens of the course
were confused by the indiscoverable and irretrace-
able maze: even in such a course do the Trojan
children entangle their steps, wewing in sport
their flight 311(ἰό conflict, like dolphins that, swim-
mino through the wet main, cleaxe the Carpathian
or Libyan seas and play amid the waves. This
manner of horsemanship, these contests Ascanius
first revived when he girt Alba Longa with walls,
and taught the Early Latius, even as he himself
solemnized them in boyhood, and with him the
Trojan youth. The Albans taught their children3
from them in turn mighty Rome received them and
kept as an ancestral observance; and to-day the

sides (eighteen ench) charged each other. Meanwhile the
three captains probably act as pivot points or mark the centre
of the field, where the chax-ging halt-companies re-form in
marching column.
