AENEID BOOK IV

thou hurlest thy bolts? And do aimless fires amid
the clouds terrify our souls and stir murmurs void
of purpose ? This woman who, sti-aying in our
bounds, set up a tiny city at a price, to whom we
gave coast-land to plough and terms of tenure, hath
spurned my offers of marriage, and welcomed Aeneas
into her realm as lord. And now that Paris ¹ with
his eunuch train, a Maeonian band propping his chin
and essenced locks, grasps the spoil3 while we bring
offerings to thy templeS, thine forsooth, and cherish
an idle story.'’

21⁹ As with such words he pleaded, clasping the
altars, the Almighty gave ear and turned his eyes
on the royal city and the lovers forgetful of their
nobler fame. Then thus to Mercury he speaks and
gives this charge: “ Go forth, my son, call the
Zephyrs, glide on thy wings, and speak to the Dardan
chief, who now dallies in Tyrian Carthage and heeds
not the cities granted by the Fates; so carry down
my words through the swift winds. Not such as
this did his lovely mother promise him to us, nor for
this twice rescue him from Grecian arms; but he was
to rule over Italy, a land teeming with empire and
clamorous with war, to hand on a race from Teucer's
noble blood, and bring all the world beneath his laws.
If the glory of such a fortune fires him not and for
his own fame’s sake he shoulders not the bui-den,
does he, the father, grudge Ascanius the towers of
Rome? What plans he? or in what hope 'carries he
among a hostile people and regards not Ausonia's
race and the Lavinian fields? Let him set sail; this
is the sum; be this the message from me.”

1 Aeneas is like Paris in carrying off another's bride. By
“Maeoniam'’ is meant Lydian, or rather Phrygiam, because
Lydia bordered on Phrygia. The Phrygian cap had on either
side a band or ribbon, which could be tied under the chin.
