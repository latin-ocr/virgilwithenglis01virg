ECLOGUE VIII

Within our garden-close Ι saw thee—I was guide for
both—a little child, along with my mother, plucking
dewy apples. My eleventh year finished, the next
had just greeted me 3 from the ground I could now
reach the frail boughs. As I saw, how was Ι lost!

How a fatal frenzy swept me away Ξ
Regin wille me, myflute, a song of Μτιεητιῖηε !

Now know I what Love is; on flinty crags Tmarus
bare him—or Rhodope, or the farthest Garamantes,
a child not of our race 01· blood ἔ

Regin with me, myflute, a song ofstlaenalus l

Ruthless Love taught a motherl to stain her hands
in her children's blood3 cruel, too, wast thou, O
mother. VVas the mother more cruel, 01· that boy
more heartless? Heartless was he; cruel, too,
wast thou, Ο mother !

Regin with me, myflate, α song of Maenalus Ι

Now let the wolf even flee before the sheep, let
rugged oaks bear golden apples, let the alder bloom
with narcissus, let tamarisks disiil rich amber from
their bark, let owls, too, vie with swam, let Tityrus
be an Orpheus—an Orpheus in the woods, an Arion
among the dolphins l

Regin with me, myflute, a song of* stIaenalusl

Nay, let all become mid-ocean! Farewell, ye
woods! Headlong from some towering mountain-
crag Ι will plunge into the waves ; this take thonas
my last dying gift! -

Cease, my flule, now θείω-θ llw song ο]
