ECLOGUE IV

11 And in thy consulship, Pollio, yea in thine, shall
this glorious age begin, and the mighty months
commence their march3 under thy sway, any linger-
ing traces of our guilt shall become void, and release
the earth from its continual dread. He shall have
the gift of divine life, shall see heroes mingled with
gods, and shall himself be seen of them, and shall
sway a world to which his father's virtues have
brought peace.

18 But sor thee, child, shall the earth untilled
pour forth, as her first pretty gifts, straggling ivy
with foxglove everywhere, and the Egyptian bean
blended with the smiling acanthus. Uncalled, the
goats shall bring home their udders swollen with
milk, and the herds shall sear not huge lions3 un-
asked, thy cradle shall pour forth flow·e1s 101 thy
delight. The serpent too, shall perish, and the
salse poison· plant shall perish3 Assyrian spice shall
spring up on every soil.

2⁶ But soon as thou canst read of the glories of
heroes and thy father-’s deeds, and canst know what
valour is, slowly shall the plain yellow with the waving
corn, on wild brambles shall hang the purple grape,
and the stubborn oak shall distil dewy honey. Yet
shall some few traces of olden sin lurk behind, to call
men to essay the sea in ships. to gird towns with walls,
and to cleave the earth with furrow s. A second Tiph3 s
shall then alise, and a second Arcto to carr3 chosen
heroes3 a second warfar‚e too, shall there be, and
again shall a great Achilles be sent to Tro3.

03⁷ Next, when now the strength of years has made
thee man, even the trader shall quit the sea, nor shall
the ship of pine exchange wares ; every land shall bear
all fruits. The earth shall not feel the harrow, nor the
vine the pruning-hook3 the sturdy ploughman, too,
