AENEID BOOK V

cleared from the cruel rock, oars lost, and one tier
erippled, Sergestus, amid jeers, brought in his
inglorious barque. Even as oft a serpent, caught
upon the highway, which a brazen wheel has crossed
aslant‚ or with blow of a heary stone a wayfarer has
crushed and left half-dead, vainly tries to escape
and trails its long eoils: pait defiant, his eyes ablaze
and his hissing nec-kraised -3110st part, maimed b3 the
wound, holding him back, as he stiuggles on with his
coils and twines himself upon his own limbs—with
such oarage, the ship moved slowly on, yet hoists
sail and under full sail makes the harbour’s mouth.
Aeneas presents Sergestus with his promised reward,
glad that the ship is saved and the crew brought
back. A slave-woman is given him, not unskilled in
Minerva's tasks, Pholoe of Cretan stock, with twin-
boys at her breast.

23⁶ This contest sped, good Aeneas moves to a
grassy plain, girt all about with winding hills, well-
wooded, where, at the heart of the valley‚ ran the·
circuit of a theatre. To this, with many thousands,
the hero betook himself into the midst of the eom-

if haply any would vie in speed of foot, he lures
them with hope of rewards aud sets up prizes.
From all sides flock Trojans and Sicilians, mingled,
Nisus and Euryalus foremost—Euryalus famed for
beauty and flower of youth, Nisus for tendet love
for the boy. Next followed princely Diores, of
Priam’s noble race; then Salius and Patron to-
gether, whereof one was an Acarnanian, the other
of Arcadian blood, a Tegean born; then two Sicilian
youths, Helymus and PanopeS, inured to the forests
