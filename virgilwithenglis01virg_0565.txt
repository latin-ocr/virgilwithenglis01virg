AENEID BOOK VI

beheld, all in long array, he moaned—Glaucus and
M edon and Thersiloclius,the three sons ofAntenor, and
Polyboetes, priest of Ceres, and Idaeus, still keeping
his car, still his arms. Round about, on right and left,
stand the souls in throngs. To have seen him once
is not enough; they delight to linger on, to pace
