deity. “Art thou slow 'co vow and to pray?'’ she
eries. “Art slow, Trojan Aeneas? For till then
the mighty mouths of the awestruck house will
not gape open.” So she spake and was mute.

frames, and their king pours forth prayers from

⁵⁶ “O Phoebus, who hast ever pitied the heavy
woes of Troy, who didst guide the Dardan shaft and
hand of Paris against the body of Aeacus' son, under
thy guidance did Ι enter so many seas, skirting
mighty lands, the far remote Massylian tribes, and
the fields the Syrtes fringe3 now at last we grasp
the shores of fleeing Italy3 thus far only may Troy's
fortune have followed us! Ye, too, may now fitly
spate the raee of Pergamus, ye gods and goddesses
all, to whom Troy and Dardania's great glory were
an offence. And thou, most holy prophetess, who
foreknowest ‘che future, grant—1 ask no realm
unpledged by my fate—that the Teucrians may rest
in Latium, with the wandering gods and storm-
tossed powers of Troy. Then to Phoebus and
Trivia will I set up a temple of solid marble, and
festal days in Phoebus' name.1 Thee also a stately
shrine awaits in our realm ;2 for here will I place
thy oracles and mystie utterances, told to my
people, and ordain chosen men, O graeious one.
Only trust not thy verses to leaves, lest they fly
in disorder, the sport of rushing winds ; chan'c them
thyseff, Ι pray.'’ His lips ceased speaking.
