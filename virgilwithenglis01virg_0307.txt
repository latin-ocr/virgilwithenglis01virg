our king.” So spoke Ilioneus, and all the sons of
Dardanus loudly shouted assent.
5⁶1 Then Dido, with downcast face, briefly speaks:
“ Free your hearts of sear, Teucrians3 put away your
cares. Stern necessity and the new estate of my king-
dom force me to do such hard deeds and protect my
frontiers far and wide with guards. Who could be
ignorant of the race of Aeneas’ people, who of
Troy’s town and her brave deeds and brave nien, or
of the fires of such a war? Not so dull are our Punic

Eryx and Acestes for your king, Ι will send you
hence guarded by an escort, and aid you with my
wealth. Or is it your wish to settle with me on
even terms within these realms? 'l'he city Ι build
is yours; draw up your ships; Trojan and 'l'yrian

your king were here, driven by the same wind

ξ One3 only is wanting, whom our own eyes saw en-
: gulfed amid the waves; all else agrees with thy
ζ mother’s words.''
