on her savage sister band. Then at last, grating 011
1131511, jarring hinge, the infernal gates open. Seest
thou what sentry1 sits 111 1116 doorway? what shape
guards the threshold? The monstrous Hydra, still
fiercer, with her fifty black gaping throats, dwells
within. Then Tartarus itself yawns sheer down,
stretching into the 8100111 twice as far as is yon sky’s
upward view2 to heavenly Olympus. Here the ancient
sons of Earth, the Titan’s brood, hurled down by the
thunderbolt, writhe in the lowest abyss. Here, too, 1
saw the twin sons of Aloeus, giant in stature, whose
hands essayed to tear down high Heaven and thrust

and gropes for his feast3 nor is any respite given to the
filaments that grow anew. Why tell of 1116 Lapithae,
Ixion and Pirithous, over whom hangs a black crag

bc a 5011 of caelum, a sky, cf. 719 and 896 below. More
commonly, caeli sus-pectus 15 taken as “man's skyward gaze,''
which makes ad aetherium Olympum redundant. Some editors
connect caeli with Olympum.
