AENEID BOOK 1

to the city3 in Ascanius all his fond parental care is
centred. Presents, too, snatched from the wreck of
Ilium, he bids him bring, a mantle stiff with figures
wrought in gold, and a veil fringed with yellow
acanthus, once worn by Argive Helen when she
sailed for Pergamos and her unlawful marriage—-
she had brought them from Mycenae, the wondrous
gift of her mother Leda—the sceptre withal, which
Ilione, Priam's eldest daughter, once had borne, a

, necklace‚ too, hung with pearls, and a coronet with

and often hast thou grieved in our grief. Phoenician
Dido now holds him, staying him with soft words, and
I dread what may be the outcome ofJuno'shospitality;
at such a turning-point of fortune she will not be idle.
Wherefore 1 purpose to out-wit the queen with guile
and encircle her with love’s flame, that so no power
may change her, but along with me she may be held

Typhoeus·
