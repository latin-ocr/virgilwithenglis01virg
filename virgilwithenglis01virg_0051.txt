ECLOGUE 111

DAMOETAS

Ye who cul] flowers and low-growing strawberriea
away from here, lads; a chill snake lurks in the

grass.
M ENALCAS

Forbear, my sheep, to go too far; 'tis ill to trust
'the bank. The ram himself is even now drying his
fleece.

muomnxs

Tityrus, turn back from the stream the grazing
goats; when the time comes, l’ll wash them all in
the spring myself.

MENALcAs

Round up the sheep, my lads; if the beat fore-
stalls the milk, as it did of late, in vain shall our
palms press the teats.

DA MOETAS

Alas, alas 1 how lean is my bull amid the fattening
tares! The same love is the bane of the herd and
the herd's master.

MENALCAS

As ‘co mine at least—and love is not to blame—
their skin scaree clings to the bones. Some evil eye
bewitehes my tender lambs.

DAMOETAS

Tell me in what land—and you shall be my great
Apollo—Heaven’s space is but three ells broad.1

1 The solution of this' riddle is uncertain. One explanation
refers it to a spendthrift Mantuan named Caelius, who was
left with only enough ground to be buried in. More probably
it refers to one looking up at the sky from the bottom of a
well or cavern.
