AENEID BOOK VI

thus: “ What god, Palinurus, tore thee from us and
plunged beneath the open ocean? O tell me! for
Apollo, never before found false, with this one
answer tricked my soul, for he foretold that thou
wouldst escape the sea and reach Ausonian shores.
Lo l is it thus his promise holds? ’' But he ε “ Neither
did tripod of Phoebus fail thee, my captain, Anchises'
son, nor did a god plunge me in the deep. For by
chance the helm to which, as my charge, Ι clung,
steering our course, was violently torn from me, and
Ι, dropping headlong, dragged it with me. By the
rough seas I swear that not for myself felt I such
sear as for thy ship, lest, stripped of its gear and reft
of its helmsman, it might fail amid such surging
waves. Three stormy nights over the measureless
seas the South drove me wildly on the water3 scarce
on the fourth dawn, aloft on the erest of a wave, I
sighted Italy. Little by little I swam shoreward,
and even now was grasping at safety, but ἃς, weighted
by dripping garb, I caught with bent finger-s at the
rugged cliff-peaks, the barbarous folk assailed me
with the sword, in ignorance deeming me a prize.
Now the wave holds me, and the winds toss me on
the beach. Oh, by heaven’s sweet light and air, Ι
beseech thee, by thy father, by the rising hope of
Iiilus, snatch me from these woes, unconquered one 1
Either do thou, for thou canst, cast earth on me ¹ and
seek again the haven of Velia3 or if there be a way,
if thy goddess-mother shows thee one-for not with-
out divine favour, Ι ween, dost thou essay to stem
these great streams and the Stygian mere-give thy
hand to one so unhappy, and take me with thee across
the waves, that at least in death I may find a quiet
resting·place ! ''

1 'l'he sprinkling of three handfuls of earth upon a dead

body was regarded as a burial.
