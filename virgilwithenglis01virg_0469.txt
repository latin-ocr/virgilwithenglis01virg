AENEID BOOK IV

Forlorn, what first shall Ι lanient? In thy death
didst thou scorn thy sister‘s company ? Thou shouldst
have called me to share thy (100111 ; the same sword—
paug, the same honr had taken us both Σ Did these
hands indeed build the pyre, and did my voice call
on our father's gods, in order that, when thou wert
lying thus, 1, the cruel one, should be sar away?
Thou hast destroyed thyself and me, O sister, the
Sidonian senate and people, and thy city! Let
me bathe her wounds with water, and catch with
my lips whatever latest breath flutters over hers 1 ''
Thus speaking, she had climbed the high steps, and,
throwing her arms round her dying sister, sobbed
and clasped her to her bosom, stanching with her
robe the dark streams of blood. She, essaying to lift
her heavy eyes, swoons again, and the deep—set
wound ghrgles in her breast. ’1111166 rising, she
strugoled to list herself upon her elbow; thrice she
10116ωᾶ back on the couch, and with w andering eyes
sought the light in high heaven, and, as she found it,
moaned.

⁶⁹³ Then alniighty Juno, pitying her long pain and
hard departure, sent Iris down 110111 Olympus to
release her struggling soul from the imprisoning
limbs. For since neither in the course of fate did she
perish‚ nor by a death she had 6·11116(1,1 but 11··1111655
before her day, and fired by sudden luadiit-ss, not 1 et
had Ρ10561111116 taken srom 1161 1163(1 the golden lock
and consigned 1161 to Stxgian Orcus. ² So Iris, all
dewy on saffron wings, flits down through the sky,

not a sels-inflicted death. cf. Aen. 11. 434.
2 Before sacrifice 3 few 113115· were plucked from the fore-

head of the victim, and as the dying were regarded as offerings
to the nether gods, a similar custom was observed in their
case.
