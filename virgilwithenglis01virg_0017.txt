LIFE OF VIRGIL

Pennus VERfflLms MAno was born October 15,
70 Be, at Andes, a district near Mantua. He was
“ of rustic parentage, and brought up in the bush
and forest‚” 1 but his father gave him a careful edu-
cation, first at Cremona, then at Milan, and lastly at
Rome. In the capital he studied especially under
Epidius the rhetorieian, and Siro, a distinguished
Epicurian.

To his student—days belong the short poenis known
as Cataleplon (κατὰ λεπτόν, ie. “small’')‚ some of
which are probably genuine. To the same period
would belong the rest of the minor poexns—the
Culex, Ciris, Copa, Dirae, and Horetum—though it is
very doubtful whether any of these are authentic.

Virgil's second period begins with 43 B.c., when,
after Caesar’s assassination, we find the poet again
in Mantua. In that year the second triumvirate
was formed, and in the year following Brutus and
Cassius were defeated at Philippi. In the subse-
quent allotment of lands to the victorious veterans
Cremona and Mantua suffered severely. The poet
was dispossessed of his farm and, attempting resist-
ance, barely escaped with his life. However‚ he
found a friend in C. Asinius Pollio, governor of
