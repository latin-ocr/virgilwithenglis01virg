LIFE OF VIRGIL

fifty-first year of his age, September 22, 19 B.C. He
was buried at Naples, and on his tomb was inscribed
the epitaph :

MANTUA ME GENUlT, CALABRI RAPUERE, TENET NUNC
PARTHENOP133 CEC1N1 PASCUA, RURA, DUCES.

Conscious of many imperfections in the Aeneid,
Virgil had begged Varius (who along with Tucca was
Virgil's literary executor), in the event of his death,
to burn the epic. It was published, however, by
order of AugustUS, who directed the executors to
edit it, removing all superfluities, but making no
additions. Examples of passages removed are
furnished by the prooemium of four lines at the
beginning of the Aeneid, and by the Helen episode
in the second book (ll. 567-588). In both cases
Virgilâ€™s dissatisfaction with the passages may have
been known to his literary friends.
