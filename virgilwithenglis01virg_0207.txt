GEORGICS BOOK III

Then, too, never does the Sun scatter the paie mists,
either when, borne on his chariot, he climbs high
Hezzven, or when he laves his headlong car in
Ocean’s crimson plain. Sudden ice—crusts form on
the running stream, and anon the water bears on its
surface iron-bound wheels—giving welcome once to
ships, but now to broad wains! Everywhere brass
splits, clothes freeze on the back, and with axes they
cleave the liquid wine; whole lakes turn into a solid
mass, and the rough icicle hardens on the unkeinpt
beard. No less, meanwhile, does the snow fill the
sky 3 the cattle perish‚ the oxen's great frames stand
sheathed in frost, the deer in crowded herd are numb
under the strange mass and above it scarce rise the
tips oftheir horns. These they hunt not by unloosing
hounds, or laying nets, or alarming with the terror of
the crimson feather,1 but as their breasts vainly sti-ain
against that mountain rampart men slay them, steel
in hand, cut them down bellowing piteously‚ and
bear them home with loud shouts ofjoy. Themselves,
in deep-dag caves, low in the earth, they live careless
and at ease, rolling to the hearths heaps of logs,
yea, whole eim-trees, and throwing them on the fire.
Here they spend the night in play, and with ale and
bitter service-juice2 joyously mimic draughts of wine.
Such is the race of nien lying under the Wain's seven
stars in the far north, a wild race, buffeted by the
Rhipaean East-wind, their bodies clothed in the
tawny furs of beasts.
