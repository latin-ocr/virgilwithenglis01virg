ConvnoN, the shepherd, was aflame for the fair
Alexis, his master‘s pet, nor knew he what to hope.
As his one solace, he would day by day come
among the thick beeches with their shady summits,
and there alone in fruitless passion fling these artless
strains to the hills and woods :

⁶ ‘⁶ O cruel Alexis, care you naught for my songs?
Have you no pity for me? You will drive me at
last to death. Now even the cattle court the cool
shade ; now even the green lizards hide in the brakes,
and Thestylis pounds for the reapers, spent with the
scorching heat, her savoury herbs of garlic and thynie.
But as Ι scan your footprints, the copses under the
burning sun ring with the shrill cicala’s voice along
with mine. Was it not better to brool< Amaryllis’
sullen rage and scornful disdain ? or Menalcas, though
he was swart and you are fair? Ah, lovely boy, trust
not too much to your bloom! The white privets
fall, the dark hyacinths are culled!

1⁰ “ You scorn me, Alexis, and ask not what Ι arn—-
how rich in cattle, how wealthy in snow-white mill< ἱ
Α thousand lambs of mine roam over the Sicilian
hills; new milk fails me not, summer or winter. I
sing as Amphion of Dirce used to sing, when calling
home the herds on Attic Aracynthus. Nor am I so
unsightly; on the shore the other ἀεὶ) Ι looked at
myself, w,hen by grace of the winds, the sea was at
peace and still. W ith you for judge, I should fear
not Daphnis, if the miri or nevel lies!

1 This Eclogue‚ probably the earliest in the collection, is
largely an imitation of two Idylls of Theocritus, viz. the third,
in which a slighted lover pours forth his comp laint, and the

elcxcnth in which the Cjclops Polyphemups bewails the
cruelty of Galatea.
