ECLOGUE Ι

often, I mind, this mishap was foretold me, had not
my wits been dull, by the oaks struck from heaven.
But still tell me, Tityrus, who is this god of yours?

TlTYRL's

The city which they call Rome, Meliboeus, l,
foolish one! thought was like this of ours‚ whither
we shepherds are wont to drive the tender younglings
of our flocks. Thus I knew puppies were like dogs‚
and kids like their dams; thus Ι used to compare
great things with small. But this one has 1··ea1ed
1161· head as high among all other cities as ey presses
oft do among· the heudino osiers.

MELIBOEUS

And what was the great occasion of your seeing

Rome ?
T1Tvnus

Freedom, who, though late, yet cast her eyes upon
me in my sloth, when my heard began to whiten as
it fell beneath the scissors. Yet she did cast her
eyes on me, and came after a long time—after
Amaryllis began her sway and Galatea left me.
For—yes, I must confess—while Galatea ruled 1116, Ι
had neither hope of freedom nor thought of savingS.
Though many a victim left my stalls, and many a rich
cheese was pressed for the thankless town, never
would my hand come home money-laden.

MELIBOEUS

I used to wonder, Amaryllis, why so sadly 1011
called on the gods, and for 11110111 you let the apples
hang on theil native trees. Tityrus was gone from
bomne. The very pines, Tityrus, the very springs,
the very orchards here were calling for you!
