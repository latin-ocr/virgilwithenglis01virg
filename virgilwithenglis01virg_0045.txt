DAMOETAS

    

MENALCAS

' You shall never, never get off! Wherever you eall
me, I will meet you. Only let the one to hear us be
-ον take the man coming yonder, Palaemon. I will
see that hereaftei· you challenge nobody to sing.

DAMOETAS

Nay come, if you have any song3 with me there
shall be no delay. No umpire (1ο I shun. Only,
'neighbour Palaemon, give this your closest heed; it
is no trifling matter.

PALAEMON

Sing on, now ’chat we are seated on the soft grass
³ Even now every field, every tree is budding3 now
⁸ the woods are green, and the year is at its fain-est.
ἵ Begin, Damoetas3 then you, Menalcas, must follow.
, Turn about you shall sing ; singing by turns the Muses

1 love.

DAMOETAS

, With Jove I begin, ye Muses; of Jove all things
3 are full. He makes the earth fruitful: he pays heed
ξ to my songs.
