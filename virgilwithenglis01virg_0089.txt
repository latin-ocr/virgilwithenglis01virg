MOERIS

O Lycidas, we have lived to 566 the day—an evil
never dreamed—-when a st1·ange1·,llolderof our little
farm, could say: “ This is 1111116; bcgone, ye old
tena11ts!” Now, beaten and cowed, since chance
rules all, we send him 'these kids—our curse go with
them!

LYCIDAS

Y et smely Ι had heard that, from 1111616 the hills
begin to rise, then sink then lldge 111 a gentle slope,
down to the watel and the old beeches with then
now shattered tops, y our Menalc· as 11 1d with his songs
saved all.
