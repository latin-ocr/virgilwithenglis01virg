GEORGICS BOOK IV

blush with their fresh hues, ere the chattering swal-
low hangs her nest from the rafters. Meantime the
moisture, warming in the softened bones, ferments,
and creatures of wondrous wise to view, footless at
first, soon with buzzing wings as well, swarm to-
gether, and more and more essay the light air, until,
like a shower pour-ing from summer clouds, they
burst forth, or like arrows from the string's rebound,
when the light-armed Parthians enter on the opening
battle.1

³¹⁵ What god, ye Muses, forged for us this device?
Whence did man’s strange adventui-ing take its rise ?
Aristaeus the shepherd, quitting Tempe by the
Peneus, when—so runs the tale—his bees were lost
through sickness and hunger, sorrowfully stopped be-
side the sacred fount at the stream's head, and with
many plaints called on his mother thus ε “ O mother,
mother Cyrene, that dwellest in this flood’s depths,
why, from the gods’ glorious line—if indeed, as thou
sayest, Thymbraean Apollo is my father—didst thou
give me birth, to be hated of the fates? Or whither
is thy love for me banished? Why didst thou bid
me hope for Heaven? Lo, even this very crown of
my mortal life, which the skilful tending of crops and
cattle had scarce wrought out for me for all my
endeavour—though thou art my mother, I resign.
Nay, come, and with thine own hand tear up my
fruitful woods3 lay the hostile flame to my stalls,
destroy my crops, burn my seedlings, and swing the
stout axe against my vines, if such loathing for my
honour hath seized thee.’'

¹ Here, according to Servius, there originally followed a
eulogy on C. Cornelius Gallus, made prefect. of Egypt by
Octavian. On his disgrace and suicide in 26 B.C. the present
beautiful episode was substituted by the poet.
