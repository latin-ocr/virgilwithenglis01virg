ECLOGUE X

⁷0 These strains, Muses divine, it will be enough
for your poet to have sung, while he sits idle and
twines a basket of slender hibiscus. These ye shall
make of highest worth in Gallus' eyes—Gallus, for
whom my love grows hour by hour as fast as in the
dawn ofspring shoots up the green alder. Let us rise ;
the shade oft brings peril to singers. The juniper’s
shade brings peril3 hurtful 'to the corn, too, is the
shade. Get ye home, my full-fed goats—the
Evening-star comes—get ye home!
