e Mv Muse first deigned to sport in Sicilian strains,
ζ and blushed 1101 10 dwell in the woods. When Ι was
ξ fain to sing of kings and battles‚¹ 1116 Cynthian
33 plucked my ear and wal-ned me: “A shepherd,
ἲ Tityrus, should seed sheep that are fat, but sing a
⁵ lay fine-spun.'' And now—for enough, and more,
ξ wilt thou find eager 10 sing thy praises, Varus, and
² build the story of grim war-now will I woo the
ἵ rustic² Muse on slender reed. Unbidden sti-ains I
sing not ; still if any there be to read even these my
ἶ lays—any whom love of the theme has won, ’tis of
ἶ 11166, Varus, our tamarisks shall sing, of thee all our
f groves. To Phoebus no page is inore welcome than

¹ Mnasyllos saw Silenus lying asleep in a cave, his
3 veins swollen, as ever, with the wine of yesterday.
ἰ Hard by lay the garlands, just fallen from his head,

ᾗ handle. Falling on him—for oft 1116 aged one had

their company and seconds the timid pair—Aegle,
F fairest of the Naiads—and‚ as now his eyes open,
. paints his face and brows with crimson mulberries.
'f Smiling at 1116 trick‚ he eries: “Why fetter me?
Ξ Loose me, lads; enough that you have shown your
ὲ power. Hear the songs you crave; you shall have
your songs, she another kind of reward.’' Therewith
Ξ 1116 sage begins, Then indeed you might see Fauns
⁴ ¹ Referring 10 epic poeti-y.

Ι ² The present poem. though called aqrestis, is rather mytho-
3 logical and philosophie (in the ancient sense of the word).
