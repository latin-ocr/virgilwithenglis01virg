and attendants on old Acestes3 with many besides,
whose same is hid in darkness. Then in their midst
Aeneas thus spoke z “ Take these words to heart and
pay cheerful heed. None of this number shall leave
without a gift from me. To each will I give two
Gnosian arrows, gleaming with polished steel, and
an axe chased with silver to bear away 3 all alike shall
have this same reward. The three first shall receive
prizes, and have pale—green olive crown their heads.
Let the first take as winner a horse gay with trap-
pings; the second an Amazonian quiver, filled with
Thracian arrOWS, girt about with a broad belt
of gold and clasped by a buckle with polished
gem3 with this Argive helmet let the third depart
content.'’

the signal heard, dash over the course, and leave
the bari-ier, streaming forth like a storm—cloud, their
eyes fixed the while upon the goal. Away goes
Nisus first, and far in front of all darts forth, swifter
than the winds or than winged thunder.bolt Next

pressing on his shoulder! And did more of the
course remain, he would shoot past him to the fore or
leave the issue in doubt! And now, with course w ell-
nigh covered, panting they neared the very goal,
when Nisus, luckless one, falls in some slippcry
blood, which, haply spilt where steers were slain,
had soaked the ground and greensward. Here,
even in the joy of triumph, the youth could not hold
hvis tottering steps on the ground he trod, but fell
prone, right in the filthy slime and blood of sacrifice.
