LIFE OF VIRGIL

Cisalpine Gaul, and in Pollio's successor (41 B.C.)‚
L. Alfenus Varus. Through Pollio he was intro-
duced to Octavius, and either recovered his farm or
received in compensation an estate in Campania.

The poenis in which virgil records his experience
at this time are the ten Eclogues, or Bucolics, which
were published in their present order in 37 B.c.
The two that are mainly concerned with the poet’s
expulsion srom his farm are the first and ninth, but
at least three, viz. the second, third, and fifth (with
probably the seventh as well), preceded the first in
point of time and, like it, were written in the poet's
native district. The sixth and ninth were composed
at Siro’s villa3 the remainder, viz. the fourth,
eighth, and tenth, were written in Rome. The
first doubtless won its place in the series because of
the tribute it pays to Octavius, who before 37 B.C.
had become sole ruler in Italy.

Seven years were devoted to the Georgics, the four
books of which were published in 29 Bc, two years
after the battle of Actium. The work was under-
taken at the request of Maecenas, to whom it is
dedicated. Though a didatic poem, being a treatise
on agriculture, the Georgics are perhaps the most
carefully finished production of Roman literature.

The rest of Virgil’s life was devoted to the Aeneid,
the greatest of Roman epics. Before it was ready
sor publication Vix-gil set out in 19 Β.ο. for Greece
and Asia, where he intended to spend the next
three years in revising his work. At Athens, how-
ever, meeting Augustus on his homeward journey
from the East, he was induced to return with the
Emperor to ltaly. A sever, contracted at Megara,
grew worse during the voyage, and ended in his
death at Brundisium, a few days after landing, in the
