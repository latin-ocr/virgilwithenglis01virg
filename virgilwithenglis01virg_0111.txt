GEORGICS BOOK Ι

‘¹3 In the dawning spring, when icy streams trickle
from snowy mountains, and the crumbling clod breaks
at the Zephyr’s touch, even 111611 would I have my
bull groan over the deep-driven plough, and 1116 share
glisten when rubbed by the furroxv. That field only
answers the covetous sarmer’s prayer, which twice
has felt the 31111 and twice the frost3 from it
boundless harvests burst the granaries. Yet ere
our iron cleaves an unknown plain, be it first our
care to learn the winds and the wavering moods ofthe
sky, the wonted tillage and nature of the ground,
what each clime yields and what each disowns.
Here corn, there grapes spring more luxuriantly;
elsewhere young trees shoot 1111, and grasses un-
bidden. See you not, how Tmolus sends us saffron
fragrance‚ India her ivory, the soft Sabaeans their
frankincense: but the naked Chalybes give us iron,
Pontus the strong-smelling beaver’s oil, and Epirus
the Olympian victories of her mares? From the
first, Nature laid these laws and eternal 601-611111113
011 certain lands, even from the day when Deucalion
threw stones into the empty world, whence sprung
111611, a stony race. Come 111611, and where the earth's
soil is rich, let your stout oxen 1111111111 11 straight-
way, in the year’s first months, and let the clods
lie for dusty summer to bake with her ripening
su11s3 but should the land not be fruitful‚ it will
suffice, on the eve of Arcturus’ rising, to raise it lightly
with shallow furrow—in the 0116 case, that weeds
may not ehoke the gladsome corn: in the other,
that the scant moisture may 1101 desert 1116 barren
sand.

116 fallow after reaping, and the plain idly stiffen
with scmf3 01, beneath another star, sow yellow
