with a challenge gave it to Bitias. He briskly
drained the foaming cup, and drank deep in the
brimming gold3 then other lords drank. Long-

the hall ring with his golden lyre. He sings of the
wandering moon and the sun's toils 3 whence sprung
human kind and the mutes, whence rain and fire3
of Arcturus, the rainy Hyades and the 'cwin ssears3
why wintry suns make such haste to dip themselves
in Ocean, or what delay stays the slowly passing
nights. With shout on shout the Tyrians applaud,
and the Trojans follow. Yea, unhappy Dido, too,
with varied talk prolonged the night and drank deep
draughts of love, asking much of Priam9 of Hector
much 5 now of the armour wherein the son of Aurora
came3 now of the wondrous steeds of Diomedes;
now of giant Achilles. “Nay, come,” she eries,
“ and tell us, my guest, from the first beginning the
treachery of the Greeks, thy comrades' missor-tunes,
and thine own wanderings ; for it is now the seventh
summer that bears thee a wanderer over every land
and sea.”
